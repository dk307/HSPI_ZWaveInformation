It also has a tamper-proof switch, which will trigger a notification when the sensor's cap is removed. These trigger signals can be used to activate various other devices and perform preprogrammed tasks. When the sensor is included into a secured Z-Wave network, all communications will be encrypted using AES encryption.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.067","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"10795","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Put the sensor into \"awake\" mode by removing the rear cover.\u00a0 When in \"awake\" mode it can receive inclusion, exclusion, and association commands from the ZIC<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":86,"label":"Monoprice","reference":514,"uuid":"monoprice","url":""},"category":{"id":6,"label":"Door","category":"Door","description":"Door sensors"},"endpoints":[{"id":1166,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":32,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SENSOR_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":10985,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10986,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10993,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_door","config":"","label":"Sensor (Binary)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3138,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":10994,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_entry","config":"type=BURGLAR, event=2","label":"Sensor (Alarm)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3139,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_tamper","config":"type=BURGLAR, event=3","label":"Tamper Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3140,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":10988,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10990,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10989,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10992,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10991,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Controller Updates","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1430}],"documents":[{"id":1772,"file":"10795-Manual-131204.pdf","label":"Monoprice Door\/Window Sensor (10795) Users Manual"},{"id":1773,"file":"21lmLb9ugjL.jpg","label":"Monoprice Door\/Window Sensor (10795)"}]}
