But there\u2019s power in simplicity. Power that allows you to inform the rest of your Z-Wave network about your selected doors and windows. Like a thermostat lets your heating and cooling systems know what they should do next, Aeotec\u2019s Z-Wave Door &amp; Window Sensor does the same. Perhaps an open door means that your lights should turn on and welcome you home. Perhaps an open window means that an alarm should be triggered. Whatever it means to your home, with door and window sensors installed, your Z-Wave network will have both the power and the intelligence\u00a0to do it.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.067","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Factory Reset:<\/p> If your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Door Window Sensor\u2019s settings to their factory defaults.
