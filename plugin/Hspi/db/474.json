When detecting overload state, the switch will be disabled and its On\/Off button will be locked, while LED will flash quickly. However, after unplug and re-connect the switch will reset its overload condition to normal state.<\/p> <p>In the front casing, there is an On\/Off button with LED indicator which is used to toggle switch on and off or carry out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association. When first power is applied, its LED flashed on and off repeatedly at 2 seconds intervals. It implies that is has not been assigned a node ID and cannot (yet) work with Z-Wave network.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"tz69","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":23,"label":"TKB Home","reference":280,"uuid":"tkb","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":582,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":5105,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5101,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5102,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1441,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":5098,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5099,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_METER","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"meter_kwh","config":"type=E_KWh","label":"Electric meter (kWh)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1436,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_current","config":"type=E_A","label":"Electric meter (amps)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1437,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_powerfactor","config":"type=E_Power_Factor","label":"Electric meter (power factor)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1438,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_watts","config":"type=E_W","label":"Electric meter (watts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1439,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_voltage","config":"type=E_V","label":"Electric meter (volts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1440,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":5104,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5097,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5103,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5100,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"LED Indicator Mode","description":"Sets whether LED should indicate device is on (1) or off (0)","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":1,"minimum":0,"maximum":1,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2888,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Switch off = LED off","id":4036},{"value":1,"label":"Switch off = LED on","id":4037}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Memory Function","description":"determines if current state is memorized on power failure","units":"","overview":"<p>Manual states: TZ69 by default value is 1, when the value is 0, TZ69 memory function not used;
