It can be mounted non-intrusive on any pipe size between 0.5 and 1.5 inch. This means the original water or gas pipe will not be opened or manipulated and it is possible to remove the Flow stop again without any damage to the water or gas pipe. Installing the Flow stop will not tamper or change any security measure applied or your gas or water installation.<\/p> <p>The device is equipped with a powerful 12 V motor providing sufficient torque to open or close any ball valve within 10 seconds. A complete manual operation of the valve remains possible due to the clutch release bearing.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.038","routing":"0","usage":"","uuid":"009501","version_max":"1.002","version_min":"1.001","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":24,"label":"Valve","category":"Valve","description":"Valves used to control water or gas. e.g. a flow stop valve."},"endpoints":[{"id":985,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":6,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_VALVE_OPEN_CLOSE"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":9018,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9009,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2625,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":9015,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2626,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":9012,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9013,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9014,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9016,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9019,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9010,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9011,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9017,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":0,"label":"LED Status","description":"No help available, self explanatory....","units":"","overview":"<p>0: LED always ON (Only on operation OFF)<br \/>1: LED always OFF (Only on operation ON)<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":1,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":3603,"options":[]},{"param_id":1,"label":"Shut-off controller behavior","description":"The parameter defines how to control the shut-off controller.","units":"","overview":"<p>0: Remote and manually open\/close<br \/>1: Remote open\/close only<br \/>2: Only remote open; only manually closing<br \/>3: Only manually open; only remote closing<br \/>4: Manually open\/close only<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":4,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":3604,"options":[]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Lifeline","max_nodes":10,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1095},{"group_id":2,"label":"Local Valve Operation","max_nodes":10,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1096}],"documents":[{"id":897,"file":"Manual-Flow-Stop-POPP-En.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":1619,"file":"pope009501.jpg","label":"Product Image"}]}
