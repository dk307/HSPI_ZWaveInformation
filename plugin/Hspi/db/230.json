It can switch all loads up to 3500 W. The device is IP 44 rated and can therefore be used both in dry environments as well as humid environments and outdoor. Switching is controlled wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally applying a button. A multi color LED indicates the switching status and the assignment of the colors to the switching status can be defined by the user. The device will report any change of the switching status to a central gateway regardless the origin of the switch (local or wireless). A built in virtual power meter will report the power consumption of the load attached. However the user must configure the assumed constant power draw of the load. The local button can control the local load but can also be used to control other functions in a Z-Wave network. The device is certified and tested against all important European Safety Regulations and fully complies with the Z-Wave Plus standard. The device supports secure communication and the firmware can be upgraded over the air (OTA).<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"05438","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":242,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":1778,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1781,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1775,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":548,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1774,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1773,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_METER","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"meter_kwh","config":"type=E_KWh","label":"Electric meter (kWh)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":546,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_watts","config":"type=E_W","label":"Electric meter (watts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":547,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1777,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1780,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1782,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1779,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1776,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"LED indication mode","description":"Set LED indication mode.","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":1,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"","write_only":"","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1561,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":2270},{"value":1,"label":"Show switch state (default)","id":2271},{"value":2,"label":"Operated by Indicator Command Class","id":2272}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Automatically switch off after x seconds.","description":"If not zero, automatically switch device off after a user defined time","units":"","overview":"<p>If not zero, automatically switch device off after a user defined time.<\/p> <ul><li>0 -&gt;
