It can dim resistive loads up to 3500 W. The device is IP 20 rated and can therefore only be used in dry environments. For dimming the devices apply leading edge phase cutting. It is therefore only possible to dim incandescent lamps and high voltage halogen lights. Low voltage halogen lights, LEDs and CFLs must not be attached. Dimming is controlled wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally applying a button. A red LED indicates the dimming status.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"tz67","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":23,"label":"TKB Home","reference":280,"uuid":"tkb","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":37,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":253,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":251,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":252,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":271,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":254,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":249,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":248,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":255,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":256,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16785,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":250,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"LED Behavior","description":"Defines the behavior of the blue LED","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":1,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1119,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"blue indicates off","id":1903},{"value":1,"label":"blue indicates on","id":1904}]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Group 1","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1273}],"documents":[{"id":1790,"file":"TZ67-User-Manual.pdf","label":"English User Manual"},{"id":1791,"file":"092103485047.png","label":"Product Image"}]}
