The product allows to dim and switch on\/off attached lighting wirelessly using a Z-wave enabled (AUS\/NZ version 921.42 MHz) controllers (compatible universal remote controllers, control panels, gateways, PC with Z-Wave USB dongle) or manually via connected manual switch.<\/p> <p>The dimmer can act as a wireless repeater to ensure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful to eliminate \u201cRF deadspots\u201d when the radio range of the Z-Wave network is infl uenced. This function is part of the Z-Wave network functionality and is set up via Z-Wave controller.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.067","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"dhszwdmiw01","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":37,"label":"Wintop","reference":151,"uuid":"wintop","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":451,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3771,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3773,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3770,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1109,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3774,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3769,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1108,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3775,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3768,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3772,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3767,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":357,"file":"Z-Wave-InWall-Dimmer-User-Manual.pdf","label":"Z-Wave InWall Dimmer User Guide"},{"id":2523,"file":"DHS-ZW-DMIW-01.png","label":"Image"}]}
