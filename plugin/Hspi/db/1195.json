Use the Wake Up Command Class to adjust the interval (in seconds, working in 600s intervals, with 600 as min and 86400 as max values). During wake-up, the sensor turns the Z-Wave radio on for 10 seconds to receive communication from the hub. Long wake-up interval will not affect how often the sensor reports motion to your hub.<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":672,"label":"Zooz","reference":634,"uuid":"zooz","url":"http:\/\/www.getzooz.com\/"},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":1892,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":18392,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18407,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18397,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":5,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_luminance","config":"type=LUMINANCE","label":"Sensor (luminance)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5181,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":18398,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18396,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18394,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18405,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18406,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":4,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_power","config":"type=POWER_MANAGEMENT","label":"Alarm (power)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5183,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_motion","config":"type=BURGLAR,event=8","label":"Alarm (motion)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5184,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_tamper","config":"type=BURGLAR,event=3","label":"Alarm (tamper)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5185,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":18403,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18404,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18401,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18400,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18393,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18399,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18402,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18395,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Basic Set Report Value Sent to Associated Devices","description":"Basic Set Report Value Sent to Associated Devices","units":"%","overview":"<p>Set the value of basic set report sent to the light associated with the sensor in Group 2 (so the light turns on to the selected brightness level). 99 is the equivalent of full brightness in Z-Wave terms.<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":99,"minimum":0,"maximum":99,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":8099,"options":[]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Enable \/ Disable Motion Reports","description":"Enable \/ Disable Motion Reports","units":"","overview":"<p>Enable or disable motion reports completely.
