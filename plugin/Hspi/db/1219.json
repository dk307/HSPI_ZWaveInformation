Revolutionary QuickFit design features a housing depth that is up to 20 percent smaller than the previous Z-Wave models. This reduced size coupled with the elimination of heat taps provides a better fit in older style boxes and multi-gang configurations. SimpleWire technology allows line and load to automatically be configured with auto-sensing line-load terminals. All of this is coupled with Z-Wave S2 and Smart Start allows for effortless installation while being safer than ever!<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.004","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Button Press Functions<\/p> <ul><li>Cycle LED= Press 3 up then 1 down to cycle through LED status<\/li> <li>Switch Mode = Press 5 up then 5 down if done successfully the LED will blink 5 times<\/li> <li>Min Threshold = Press 4 down then 1 up, if done successfully the device will turn to 1% and the LED will start to blink signaling the device is in setup mode.
