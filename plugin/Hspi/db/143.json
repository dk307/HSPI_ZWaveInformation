The device is delivered as complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series Everlux in color white from REV \/ Duewi. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the switch is indicated on a dual color LED for test purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. The function of the local paddle can be configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control, different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zme05431","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":22,"label":"Z-Wave.Me","reference":277,"uuid":"zwaveme","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":34,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":215,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":213,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":214,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":74,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":217,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":216,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1158,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":223,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":222,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_CONTROLLER_CONF","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":210,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":209,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":218,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":221,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":212,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":211,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":220,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":219,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Set LED indication mode","description":"","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":3,"minimum":0,"maximum":3,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1008,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":1529},{"value":1,"label":"Show switch state","id":1530},{"value":2,"label":"Night mode","id":1531},{"value":3,"label":"Remote by indicator command class","id":1532}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Automatic switch off","description":"If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time","units":"","overview":"","size":2,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":65535,"read_only":"","write_only":"","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1009,"options":[]},{"param_id":3,"label":"Function of RF off command","description":"Function of RF off command","units":"","overview":"<p>\u00a0Defines how to interpret RF Off command.
