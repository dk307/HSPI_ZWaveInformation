Using RF technology allows Leviton to provide the greatest signal integrity possible. Each module in Leviton\u2019s Vizia RF +TM component line is a Z-Wave\u00ae enabled device. In a Z-Wave\u00ae network, each device is designed to act as a router. These routers will re-transmit the RF signal from one device to another until the intended device is reached. This ensures that the signal is received by its intended device by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. The Electronic Low Voltage Dimmer is compatible with any Z-Wave\u00ae enabled network, regardless of the manufacturer and can also be used with other devices displaying the Z-Wave\u00ae logo.<\/p> <ul><li>This is a Z-Wave\u00ae controller<\/li> <li>Controls dimming of load<\/li> <li>ON\/OFF LED and Brightness LED<\/li> <li>Two way communication<\/li> <li>RF reliability<\/li> <li>Ease of installation - No new wiring<\/li> <li>Compatible with other Z-Wave\u00ae enabled devices<\/li> <\/ul>","protocol_version":"3.052","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"vre06","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":33,"label":"Leviton","reference":29,"uuid":"leviton","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":664,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":4,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_SCENE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":5800,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5797,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5796,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1649,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":5799,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5805,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1650,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":5804,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5801,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5803,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5795,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5802,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5798,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":5806,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_PROPRIETARY","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Group 1","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":335}],"documents":[{"id":1477,"file":"DZS15-1LZ-175.png","label":"Product Image"},{"id":1481,"file":"Instruction-Sheet-VRE06.pdf","label":"User Manual"}]}
