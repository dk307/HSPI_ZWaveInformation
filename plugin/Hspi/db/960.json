It can be installed on any place on the outside of the house and can be controlled using Z-Wave. The device will issue a very loud sound (105 dBm) and in parallel some stroboscope light as well. The siren is self-protecting. Removing the main device from the mounting unit immediately starts the siren and also reports the tamper attempt to the ZWave central controller. All communication between the Z-Wave controller and the siren is encrypted and secured to protect against manipulation.<\/p> <p>Thanks to the large solar panel, the siren can be mounted on nearly every place outside the house where it\"s recommended to place it in indirect sun light to prevent strong heating-up the housing. The siren is maintenance-free and water-proofed (IP56). The average solar energy of one day keeps the device alive for up to 50 days (without using the siren). Additionally, an internal temperature sensor reports the temperature inside the siren\u2019s enclosure.<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.200","routing":"1","usage":"<p>The siren can be turned on and off using wireless commands. To protect this communication from misuse is strongly recommended to operate the siren in secure communication mode. The secure communication is activated on default during inclusion unless explicitly suppressed. When activated the siren will generate a 105 dB alarm sound and a flash light. This behavior can be configured as well using configuration parameter 5. Make sure to deactivate the tamper protection before removing an included siren from the mounting plate.<\/p> <p>It is possible&nbsp;to power the Siren from an external power supply. Please use any 12 V DC power with minimum of 1 W output.&nbsp;The terminals marked with E ( see ill1 for more details) allows to connect the power source to the device. its recommended ot detach the cables to the solar cell in this operating mode.<\/p>","uuid":"700854","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"2.004","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp &
