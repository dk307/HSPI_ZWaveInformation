Protect your property from water damage! The Flood Detector is designed to sense the presence of water in basements, yachts and many others residential and commercial applications, providing early warning of developing floods. The Flood Detector is designed so that the transceiver is mounted on the wall and the flood sensor is placed in a location where water presence, such as a result of leakage or flooding, is probable. Upon flood detection, the Detector will beep and flash and report its status to the node ID. Once water is released, it will report to the node ID as well.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"2.064","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"st812","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Not provided<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":66,"label":"ZyXEL","reference":309,"uuid":"zyxel","url":""},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":300,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":161,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_ALARM"},"specific_class":{"id":2,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_ALARM_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":2353,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2347,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2345,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2352,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2348,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2349,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2350,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2346,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2351,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_ALARM","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_flood","config":"type=FLOOD","label":"Alarm (flood)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":700,"options":[]}]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Basic Level Set","description":"The value sent with Basic commands in case of detected flood","units":"","overview":"<p>0 = Off<\/p>\r\n<p>1-99 = On (Binary Switch Device),\u00a0\u00a0Dim Level (Multilevel Switch Device)<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":99,"minimum":0,"maximum":99,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2032,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"OFF","id":2907}]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Power applied and Sensor Alarm","max_nodes":1,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"<p>The Detector will send ALARM_REPORT command to the nodes of Group 1 to inform the devices that the Detector is powered up.<\/p>\r\n<p>ALARM_REPORT Command: [Command Class Alarm, Alarm Type = 0x02, Alarm Level = 0x01]<\/p>\r\n<p>The second type for Group 1 is SENSOR_ALARM_REPORT.\u00a0 255 = Alarm, 00 = Event clear.<\/p>\r\n<p>The third type for Group 1 is ALARM_REPORT type 0x01, Low battery<\/p>","id":575},{"group_id":2,"label":"Device control","max_nodes":3,"controller":"0","description":"Group to send trigger value to","overview":"<p>Will send values of 0-99 to devices in Group 2.\u00a0 Set the value to send in Parameter 1.<\/p>","id":576}],"documents":[{"id":1323,"file":"ST812.jpeg","label":"Product Image"},{"id":1324,"file":"Everspring-ST812.pdf","label":"User Manual"}]}
