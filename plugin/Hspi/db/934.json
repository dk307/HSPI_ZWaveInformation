consumption, and detect leaks in your home or building.<\/p> <p>This is an integral part to a complete water management solution.\u00a0 Flow Meter tracks water usage and reports gallons used.\u00a0 Track your households water usage and drill into reports to find out where your peak consumption is and make changes to reduce your water bills.<\/p> <p>Flow meter tells you if water is flowing or if it\u2019s off.\u00a0 It knows if the flow is small, like a running toilet, or if it\u2019s large, like a garden hose left on.<\/p> <p>Flow meter can detect leaks or fixtures left on.\u00a0 It tracks usage and allows you create smart triggers using your Z-wave home automation system.\u00a0 To add to it\u2019s capabilities, flow meter checks the temperature in the nearby surrounds to detect for freezing conditions and sends temperature alerts.<\/p> <p>There\u2019s also a backup battery, just in case power is interrupted.\u00a0 You won\u2019t have to worry about lost data or lack of leak monitoring.\u00a0 Plumbed on the water main, flow meter is sure to be a valuable part of your total home automation &amp; leak prevention
