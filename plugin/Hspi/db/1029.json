This device has a number of innovative solutions, including:<\/p> <h2>SENSO technology<\/h2> <ul><li>programming of endpoints automatically or using the remote control,\u00a0<\/li> <li>operation regardless of the used hangers type,\u00a0<\/li> <li>bidirectional obstacles detection which eliminates failures due to obstacles (each failure will be reported to controller as an alarm)<\/li> <li>saving your time due to lack of supervision of your shutters - obstacle detection system, insensitive to minor disruption during work.<\/li> <\/ul><h2>Communication standard<\/h2> <p>But the most important feature of our motor is the usage of Z-Wave technology as the communication standard. It provides inter alia<\/p> <ul><li>easy procedure of connection the device to the network,<\/li> <li>bidirectional communication between the motor operator and control device - therefore the user has
