The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be congured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller.<\/p> <p>The status of the motor control is indicated on a dual color LED for test purposes and every status change is - if congured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. The function of the local paddle can be congured as detached from the local operation.
