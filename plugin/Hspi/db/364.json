With the use of the included Weather Station USB KEY all 10 values (end points) are sent and rendered in your home Z-Wave network. Qubino Weather Station Key is used for receiving Wireless data packages (from Thermo\/ Hygro Sensor Ch1, Thermo\/ Hygro Sensor Ch2, Rain Gauge, Wind Gauge) and sends it to the Z-Wave Controller. The Key is designed to be plugged into the USB Power Adapter. Module receives data for Temperature, Wind Chill, Velocity, Wind Gust, Wind Direction, Humidity, Rain Rate and Battery Level for each Sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network.<\/p> <p>Remote Weather Sensors The remote weather sensors include a thermo-hygrometer, anemometer (wind sensor) and rain sensor. All data collected by the sensors are transmitted to the Weather Station Key by wireless RF, with a range up to 100 meters (open area). The Weather station Key supports a maximum of 2 thermo-hygrometers, allowing 2 channels of temperature\/humidity display (Ch1 and Ch2)<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zmnhzd","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":36,"label":"Goap","reference":345,"uuid":"qubino","url":"http:\/\/www.qubino.com\/"},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":372,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":33,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3032,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3034,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3027,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":5,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_velocity","config":"type=VELOCITY","label":"Sensor (velocity)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":850,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":851,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_relhumidity","config":"type=RELATIVE_HUMIDITY","label":"Sensor (relative humidity)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":852,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_direction","config":"type=DIRECTION","label":"Sensor (direction)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":853,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_rainrate","config":"type=RAIN_RATE","label":"Sensor (rain rate)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":854,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3035,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3031,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3033,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3029,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3028,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3030,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]},{"id":373,"number":1,"label":"Endpoint 1","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":33,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3040,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3036,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":5,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Thermo\/ Hygro Sensor Ch1 \u2013 Temperature","overview":"<p>Endpoint 1 receives Temperature data from Thermo\/ Hygro Sensor on Channel 1.

If you replace the batteries in the modules, the Random ID will change.
