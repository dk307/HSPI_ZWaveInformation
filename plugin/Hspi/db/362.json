The ZDM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level.

If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. If this bit is set to 0, the dimmer will not ignore the start level.","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":1,"minimum":0,"maximum":1,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2942,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"No","id":4097},{"value":1,"label":"Yes","id":4098}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Suspend group 4","description":"Temporarily disable transmitting commands to Group 4 ","units":"","overview":"<p>You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without \u201cdisassociating\u201d those devices from the group.
