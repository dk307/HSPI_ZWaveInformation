When paired with a compatible hub, the hardwired smart dimmer operates wall, ceiling and accent lighting through individual commands and programmed settings. Wirelessly control and schedule indoor or outdoor fixtures for effortless management of your home. Your automation possibilities are seemingly infinite when connected to hubs from Ring, Wink, SmartThings, HomeSeer, Vera, Nexia and more.<\/p> <h4>Features<\/h4> <ul><li>ALEXA COMPATIBLE - REQUIRES AN ALEXA SUPPORTED HUB for voice control with Echo Products (Alexa device and hub sold separately). CANNOT connect directly with ECHO PLUS (Only ZigBee products can connect directly to Echo Plus).<\/li> <li>Wirelessly schedule, control and adjust the brightness of any dimmable wall or ceiling light - control from anywhere, at any time with any mobile device. Supported voltage - 120 VAC. Wireless Range: Up to 150 feet<\/li> <li>SPACE-SAVING HOUSING DESIGN \u2013Improved components reduced the housing depth by up to 20 percent compared to previous Z-Wave models and eliminated the need for heat tabs.<\/li> <li>Quick Fit enhancements are the ideal smart solution for older-style switch boxes, multi-gang configurations or any other application with limited space.<\/li> <li>EASY INSTALLATION WITH SIMPLE WIRE \u2013 Auto line-load sensing terminals support fast and easy installation by detecting line and load wires and configuring the dimmer accordingly.<\/li> <li>Dual ground ports, which are offset to avoid switch box mounting screws, support daisy-chaining in multi-switch setups.<\/li> <li>REQUIRES A Z-WAVE CERTIFIED GATEWAY - Compatible with the following Z-Wave certified Hubs: SmartThings, Wink, ADT Pulse, Trane, Vivint, Nexia, Honeywell, HomeSeer, Harmony Home Hub Extender, Vera, Connect and Iris.<\/li> <li>INSTALLATION &amp; USAGE - Requires in-wall installation with hard-wired connections - Neutral wire REQUIRED.
