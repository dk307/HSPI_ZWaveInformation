In a Z-Wave\u00ae network, each device is designed to act as a router. These routers will re-transmit the RF signal from one device to another until the intended device is reached. This ensures that the signal is received by its intended device by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. The Scene Capable Electronic Switch is compatible with any Z-Wave\u00ae enabled network, regardless of the manufacturer and can also be used with other devices displaying the Z-Wave\u00ae logo.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.052","routing":"1","usage":"<p>LED Option: <\/p> <p>Sets the Locator LED timeout to 5 seconds after use.
