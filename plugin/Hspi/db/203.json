You must perform exclusion process first if need to change Z-Wave operation mode.<\/li> <li>After Z-Wave inclusion process, if you reset ZTS-110 to default while both 24Vac and batteries are applied, ZTS-110 will take 24Vac as primary power source and self-configure to Always Listening Mode, because reset to default process will automatically exclude ZTS-110 from the Z-Wave network. You should disconnect the power source and re-apply the power so ZTS-110 can detect the power source type and self-configure to corresponding mode.<\/li>
