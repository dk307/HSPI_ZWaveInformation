This ZW500DM dimmer switch is fully compatible with other Z-Wave devices, provides programmable function creating a perfect ambiance such as scenes, association, schedule event, etc. Also it can be added to most Z-Wave compliant controllers.<\/p> <p>Sliding Air-Gap switch to totally disconnect power while replacing light bulbs and preventing from leakage current from the fixture(s). This ZW500DM dimmer works with ZW3K 3-Way Auxiliary Switch that reduces energy consumption, enhancing the value of technology of your home, condominiums and apartment.<\/p> <p>Features -:<\/p> <ul><li>Perfect Replacement for regular wall ON\/OFF &amp; Dim switch, 120VAC<\/li> <li>Wireless Z-Wave technology creates a mesh network for command and control interoperability with other Z-Wave compliant controller and devices<\/li> <li>Manual and Remote ON\/OFF&amp; Dim control of any permanently installed incandescent, dimmable LED and CFL lamp fixture<\/li> <li>Preset light level option allows the dimmer will turn on to the light level that it was adjusted to the previous time when the light was on<\/li> <li>Can be used for single pole or 3- Way (Multi-location) with ZW3K Auxiliary Switch (sold separately)<\/li> <li>Measures energy usage of the wired load<\/li> <\/ul><p>The ZW500DM Smart Meter Dimmer Switch enables you to measure the energy usage of your appliance. When added to a Z-Wave network, the ZW500DM reports real time data to your gateway or controller. It can also display actual consumption (in W) and the accumulated power used (in kWh) in the user interface of the gateway\/remote. Please use the gateway installation manual for specific instructions on measuring the
