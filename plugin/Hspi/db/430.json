The CDx is connected to the PCU-ECx. Via CDx the user can control locally the Ventilation Unit.<\/li> <li>Z-Wave to Systemair HVAC Interface Adapter, which connects the Z-Wave network with the Ventilation Unit.<\/li> <\/ul><p><strong>Application status <\/strong><\/p> <p>Some of the implemented CCs need to be translated to the Ventilation Unit via the Modbus interface. Due to some reasons that communication couldn\u2019t be available, for example \u2013 disconnected\/damaged communication cable. In order to cover such situations, the Application Status Command Class has been implemented. So, In case of no communication between Z-Wave Adapter and the Ventilation Unit Module, the Device will send \u201cApplication Reject Request\u201d for all Z-Wave commands required communication with the Ventilation Unit. If the Modbus communication is up and running, the device is always available to respond in the specified time, i.e. the device will never report \u201cApplication Busy\u201d command.<\/p> <p><strong>Associations<\/strong><\/p> <p>The Device supports one, the Lifeline Association Group only. Maximum 5 nodes can be added to that group. The device uses the Lifeline group to send the following unsolicited reports:<\/p> <ul><li>Thermostat Mode Report \u2013 when thermostat mode changes<\/li> <li>Thermostat Setpoint Report \u2013 when the temperature setpoint changes<\/li> <li>Thermostat Fan Mode Report \u2013 when the fan level changes<\/li> <li>Notification Report \u2013 when an alarm occurs<\/li> <li>Switch Binary Report \u2013 when the device enter\/exit the Boost mode<\/li> <li>Device Reset Locally \u2013 at factory reset<\/li> <\/ul><p><strong>Temperature setpoint<\/strong><\/p> <p>The device supports \u201cThermostat Auto changeover\u201d setpoint type only. The setpoint range varies in depend of the ventilation system type and some other ventilation unit configurations. All of these dependencies must be fixed at inclusion time, so the system will be fully defined. The Host shall retrieve the setpoint range using the Thermostat Setpoint Capabilities Get V3 command. In additional to the reported Min and Max Values, 0\u00b0C is supported as well. The device accepts the setpoints in a predefined step in the reported range. It is available via the Configuration CC, parameter 5.<\/p> <p><strong>Fan mode<\/strong><\/p> <p>The device will support Fan Auto Mode, if both RH and CO2 sensors are present. This must be done at inclusion time. The Z-Wave Systemair Ventilation supports following Thermostat Fan Modes:<\/p> <p><strong>Boost Mode <\/strong><\/p> <p>The Systemair Z-Wave Ventilation has implemented a Boost Mode. That mode overrides the selected fan speed, setting it to a predefined level (usually high) for a predefined time period. To set the Boost Mode remotely via Z-Wave, the Binary Switch CC is used. But that binary switch is a bit special \u2013 Once it is turned ON, it locks itself in ON position for the predefined time period, and it can\u2019t be turned off until that time period expires. The Host can use the Ventilation System Boost mode in case of smoke or fire alarm for example.<\/p> <p><strong>Alarms<\/strong><\/p> <p>The implemented Notification CC V3 is used to report the device malfunctions:<\/p> <ul><li>Notification Type 0x09 \u2013 \u201cSystem\u201d<\/li> <li>Event Type 0x03 \u2013 \u201cSystem Hardware Failure with manufacture proprietary code\u201d<\/li> <\/ul><p>The failures are reported in a two bytes value, where each bit represents a certain alarm. If the bit is set (1) the alarm is active, and if the bit is cleared (0) the alarm is not active.<\/p> <p>Any bit\u2019s transition from 0 to 1 will trigger an unsolicited Notification Report. The system maintains a repeat timeout counter for each alarm, which is hard coded to 24 hours. So, an alarm occurrence runs its counter. When the repeat time expires and the alarm still exists (its bit is set) a new unsolicited Notification Report will be send. A bit\u2019s transition from 1 to 0 clears its repeat counter. The alarms are generated in the Ventilation Unit.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"29990","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":89,"label":"Systemair Sverige AS","reference":630,"uuid":"systemair","url":""},"category":{"id":9,"label":"HVAC","category":"HVAC","description":"Air condition devices, Fans"},"endpoints":[{"id":500,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":8,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_THERMOSTAT"},"specific_class":{"id":6,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_THERMOSTAT_GENERAL_V2"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":4276,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4277,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4275,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_APPLICATION_STATUS","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4282,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Boost mode","overview":"<p>The Systemair Z-Wave Ventilation has implemented a Boost Mode.
