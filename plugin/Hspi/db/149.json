Devices can be turned on and off but dimmers and motor controls can also be turned into a desired dimming level to motor position by keeping a button pushed and releasing it. Although it is controlling other devices, the device can not act as ZWave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network.<\/p> <p>The device can be used in different modes that are selected by configuration parameters 11-21:<\/p> <ol><li>Direct control of associated devices<\/li> <li>Control of all devices in the Z-Wave network<\/li> <li>Simple and enhanced scene activation<\/li> <\/ol><p>10 pair of buttons - illuminated by blue light when operated - allow to control up to 10 control groups (either association groups or scenes)<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.067","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zmerc2","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time. Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller C is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store commands that can not be received during deep sleep state. Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and\/or the battery life time is significantly decreased.<\/p> <p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification. The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal battery life time and the desired responses of the device.<\/p> <p>Pressing the \"INCL.\" button for three times will wake up the device.<\/p> <p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup.<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":22,"label":"Z-Wave.Me","reference":277,"uuid":"zwaveme","url":""},"category":{"id":23,"label":"Remote Control","category":"RemoteControl","description":"Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":459,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":18,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_REMOTE"},"specific_class":{"id":2,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_SWITCH_REMOTE_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3872,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3869,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3887,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3886,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1124,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3874,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3875,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3876,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3870,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3873,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3871,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3885,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":10,"label":"Command to Control Group No1 (Assoc.
