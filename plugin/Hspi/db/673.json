The module can be power supplied from a 230V AC mains connectio, and is able to deliver an output supply of 24V DC.<\/p> <p>LHC5031 inputs are able to be freely controlled from the Z-Wave network, and can be used for several purposes, e.g. on\/off control of light, control of valve actuators for an underfloor heating system, or control of other home automation systems.<\/p> <p>LHC5031 inputs are
