Its bulb has the Smart RGB LEDs in, which can be used for adding colour to your home, the bulb has 5 main colour channels available for you to adjust: Red, Green, Blue, Warm white and Cold white. You can configure its indication colour according to your favour.<\/p> <p>The LED Bulb can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.<\/p> <p>The LED Bulb is a security Z-Wave device, so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the LED Bulb.
