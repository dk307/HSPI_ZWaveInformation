Slim design let the Controller can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration.<\/p> <p>The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of Roller Shutter. This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is able to detect position of the Shutter by using the patterned power measuring method, so it can be remote controlled not only fully up or down , but also can be adjusted to ex. 30% or 50%. And when manual controlled by push button, the controller also can memorize the position and send the new shutter position to its controller (ex. IP-Gateway).<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.095","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"pan081a","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Device is not battery operated, hence no wakeup
