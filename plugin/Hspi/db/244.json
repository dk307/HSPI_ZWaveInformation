They are even smaller than their counterparts PM<sub>10<\/sub>, which are particles that are 10 <a title=\"How Small Is One Micron and Why It Matters\" href=\"https:\/\/blissair.com\/how-small-one-micron-why-matters.htm\">micrometres<\/a> or less, and are also called <strong>fine particles<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since they are so small and light, fine particles tend to stay longer in the air than heavier particles. This increases the chances of humans and animals inhaling them into the bodies. Owing to their minute size, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers are able to bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system.<\/p>\r\n<p>Studies have found a close link between exposure to fine particles and premature death from heart and lung disease. Fine particles are also known to trigger or worsen chronic disease such as asthma, heart attack, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blissair.com\/what-is-pm-2-5.htm\">Source<\/a><\/p>","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2032,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2033,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":7053,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7051,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7049,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Group 1","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":464}],"documents":[{"id":226,"file":"MH10-PM2-5-UM.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":840,"file":"MH10-PM2-5-WA.png","label":"Product Image"}]}
