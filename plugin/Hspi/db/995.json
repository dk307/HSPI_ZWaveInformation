After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in Learning Mode. If you are using the WiDom Multi Sensor Room Controller, the procedure of exclusion can be activated by Removing a node from the Z-Wave network and any click sequence on the integrated button; as soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED and the App_status in the interface is OK.\u00a0<\/p>","first_approval_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","frequently_listening":"0","inclusion":"<p>WiDom Smart TE Dimmer is compatible with all Z-Wave\/Z-Wave Plus certified controllers. The device supports both the Network Wide Inclusion mechanism (which offers the ability to be included in a network, even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and Normal Inclusion. By default, the inclusion procedure starts in Normal Inclusion mode and after a short timeout the procedure continues in Network Wide Inclusion mode that lasts for about 20 Seconds.<\/p> <p>Before including the device the LED status indicator is solid RED. The procedure of inclusion is activated by clicking Add in the inclusion interface and by pressing any sequence of click on the integrated button. As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks.
