The Appliance Module is plugged into any standard grounded AC wall outlet, and the appliance or other device is then plugged into the module. Once connected, the appliance\/device can be easily turned ON or OFF remotely via the Z-Wave network.<\/p> <p>This device is compatible with Z-Wave security systems and can handle a maximum of the following loads:<\/p> <ul><li>Incandescent \u2013 600W, 120 VAC<\/li> <li>Resistive \u2013 15 amps (1800 watts), 120 VAC<\/li> <li>Motor \u2013 \u00bd H.P., 120 VAC<\/li> <\/ul><p>This Plug-in Appliance Module is designed to work with other Evolve enabled devices. Evolve nodes of other types can be included in the network and will also act as repeaters to increase the range of the network.<\/p> <p>As part of a Z-Wave network, the LPM-15 will also act as a wireless repeater to ensure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"lpm15","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":9,"label":"Evolve","reference":275,"uuid":"evolve","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":778,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":3,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_SCENE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":6946,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6939,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6937,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1995,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":6942,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6945,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1996,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":6938,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6940,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6941,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6944,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6943,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6936,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":3,"label":"Night Light","description":"Defines the behavior of the blue LED; default has LED on when switch is off.","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":4961,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"LED on when switch is OFF","id":6912},{"value":1,"label":"LED on when switch is ON","id":6913},{"value":2,"label":"LED always off","id":6914}]},{"param_id":4,"label":"Invert Switch","description":"Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON.","units":"","overview":"<p>Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":4962,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"No","id":6915},{"value":1,"label":"Yes","id":6916}]}],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":823,"file":"LPM-15.jpg","label":"Product Image"},{"id":1404,"file":"LPM-15.pdf","label":"Evlovle LPM-15 Product Overview"}]}
