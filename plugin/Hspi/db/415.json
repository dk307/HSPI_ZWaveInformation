The four buttons can control other Z-Wave devices such as switches, dimmer and even door locks directly. Various options - configurable by Z-Wave configuration commands - define the actions and the commands used for this control. It is possible to use two sets of buttons (one of on\/open\/up and one for off\/closed\/down) or 4 single buttons to control 4 different groups of devices.<br \/><br \/>The controller also allows triggering scenes in a central controller. Again different modes can be configured to adapt to the various implementations of scenes in different central controllers in the market.<br \/><br \/>Control options also include special modes like \"all on\/off\" or always controlling the Z-Wave device in proximity to the fob.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.099","routing":"0","usage":"","uuid":"009204","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Enter management mode\u00a0 by push all four buttons together for one second - green led blinks slowly), then hit button 2 .<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":23,"label":"Remote Control","category":"RemoteControl","description":"Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":475,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":1,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_CONTROLLER"},"generic_class":{"id":1,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_GENERIC_CONTROLLER"},"specific_class":{"id":6,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_REMOTE_CONTROL_SIMPLE"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":4046,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4045,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4042,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_CONTROLLER_CONF","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4040,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4036,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4044,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1164,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4047,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4039,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4041,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4035,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4037,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4048,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4043,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4050,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4049,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4038,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CMD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode","description":"In separate mode button 1 works with Group A, button 3 with Group C.","units":"","overview":"<p>In separate mode button 1 works with Group A, button 3 with Group C.
