It\u2019s a motion sensor and it\u2019s also so much more. Installing this 1 piece of Z-Wave\u00aetechnology is the same as installing 6 pieces of Z-Wave technology. Your home control network will immediately understand motion, temperature, humidity,light, Ultraviolet and Vibration readings wherever MultiSensor is installed. Those intelligent readings will equate to intelligent automation. And intelligent automation will give you the perfect smart home.<br \/>MultiSensor can be powered by battery or by USB with an appropriate adaptor.<\/p> <p>Technical Specifications:<\/p> <ul><li>Power Input: 5V 1A<\/li> <li>Battery Type: 2x CR123A (not included)<\/li> <li>Temperature Sensor Range: 32\u00baf -104\u00baf (0\u00bac -40\u00bac)<\/li> <li>Motion Sensor Field of View: 100\u00ba<\/li> <li>Motion Sensor Range: 16 feet<\/li> <li>Humidity Sensor Range: 20-80%<\/li> <li>Light Sensor Range: 0-30000 Lux<\/li> <li>UV Sensor Range: 1-11 Index level<\/li> <li>Dimensions: 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.5 inches<\/li> <\/ul><p><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>","protocol_version":"0.000","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Resetting your MultiSensor:<\/p> <p>At some stage or your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may also wish to reset all of your MultiSensor\u2019s settings to their factory defaults.
