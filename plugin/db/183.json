Sensors, control and actuator are combined in one single device allowing stand alone energy efficient room control.<\/p> <p>The device can run in four different operation modes (Off, Energy Saving, Comfort, Direct Control) to control the temperature. The room temperature can also be reported by the device. Open windows will be recognized and lead to a lower control temperature for 20 minutes to prevent waste of energy.<\/p>","protocol_version":"7.002","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"stellaz","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>A single click on button behind the round hole in the enclosure wakes up the device when sleeping.<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":29,"label":"Eurotronics","reference":328,"uuid":"eurotronic","url":""},"category":{"id":17,"label":"Radiator Control","category":"RadiatorControl","description":"Controls on radiators used to heat up rooms"},"endpoints":[{"id":157,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":8,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_THERMOSTAT"},"specific_class":{"id":6,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_THERMOSTAT_GENERAL_V2"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":1072,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1073,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1071,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":379,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1074,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":380,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1076,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":4,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":381,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1069,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_THERMOSTAT_MODE","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"thermostat_mode","config":"","label":"Thermostat mode","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":376,"options":[{"name":"Off","value":"0","config":"modeType=OFF","overview":""},{"name":"Heat","value":"1","config":"modeType=HEAT","overview":""},{"name":"Economy Heat","value":"11","config":"modeType=HEAT_ECON","overview":""},{"name":"Manual","value":"31","config":"modeType=MANUAL","overview":""}]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1070,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_THERMOSTAT_SETPOINT","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"thermostat_setpoint","config":"type=HEATING_ECON","label":"Setpoint (furnace)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":377,"options":[]},{"name":"thermostat_setpoint","config":"type=HEATING","label":"Setpoint (heating)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":378,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1075,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1079,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1077,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1078,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":105,"file":"productattachments-files-e-u-eur-stellaz.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":498,"file":"stellaz.jpg","label":"Product Image"}]}
