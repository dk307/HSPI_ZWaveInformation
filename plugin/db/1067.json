The wall controller can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.<\/p> <p>Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary), so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the device. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product\u2019s firmware upgrade. The wall controller has following functions:<\/p> <ol><li>Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF', Dim and Color Control commands.<\/li> <li>Activation of scenes in Gateways.<\/li> <\/ol><p>The encryption modes that the wall controller supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the wall controller is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller\/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).<\/p> <h1>Product Data<\/h1> <table><tr><td>Z-Wave Frequency<\/td> <td>908.42 MHz (US)<\/td> <\/tr><tr><td>Power Supply<\/td> <td>100-240VAC, 50\/60Hz<\/td> <\/tr><tr><td>Power Consumption<\/td> <td>&lt; 0.5W<\/td> <\/tr><tr><td>Operating temperature<\/td> <td>0 to 40\u00b0C<\/td> <\/tr><tr><td>Relative humidity<\/td> <td>8% to 80%<\/td> <\/tr><tr><td>Dimensions<\/td> <td>75mm x 120mm x 29.1mm<\/td> <\/tr><tr><td>Material<\/td> <td>Tempered glass panel with capacitive touch buttons\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr><\/table><h1>Installation Guide<\/h1> <p>Please read carefully the enclosed user manual before installation of wall controller, in order to ensure an error-free functioning.<\/p> <p>The wall controller unit supplied as complete set for flush mounting in the standard US size wall boxes.<\/p> <p><strong>ATTENTION<\/strong>: Only authorized technicians under consideration of the country specific installation guidelines\/norms may do works with 100-240V mains power.
