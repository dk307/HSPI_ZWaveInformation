The ZRTSI resides as a bridge controller node within a Z-Wave Network and becomes a repeating node in the mesh network. The ZRTSI also features Network Wide Inclusion (NWI) which allows inclusion and exclusion to take advantage of the mesh topology of Z-Wave networks. Z-wave devices from all manufacturers can be used in the same network togethe<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"0","usage":"","uuid":"zrtsivnode","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":78,"label":"Somfy","reference":71,"uuid":"somfy","url":"http:\/\/www.somfy.com\/"},"category":{"id":2,"label":"Blinds","category":"Blinds","description":"Roller shutters, window blinds, etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":389,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":3,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":5,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_CLASS_A_MOTOR_CONTROL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3132,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3129,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3133,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":876,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3131,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"blinds_control","config":"","label":"Blinds control","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":875,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3135,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":877,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3134,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3130,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":308,"file":"ZRTSI-Instructions-1811265.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":819,"file":"ZRTSI.jpg","label":"Product Image"}]}
