While updating the device works normally. Just when the firmware update completes, the device will be inactive for few seconds during self-programming and rebooting. During the reboot process, the local loads (if present) will be disengaged. Should the firmware update fail, the whole updating process must be restarted from the beginning. The updating will last from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the network traffic condition.<\/p> <h2>Factory Reset<\/h2> <ol><li>Start the factory default procedure by pressing and holding the hidden button on the front end top-back of the device till the buzzer plays a long beep (5 s).<\/li> <li>Release the button and press it again till the buzzer plays a sequence of 3 short beeps.<\/li> <li>The device will revert to its factory default settings, blinking all LED buttons and rebooting.
