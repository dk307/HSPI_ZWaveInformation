It can dim all incandescent lights, high voltage halogen lamps and transformers operated low voltage lamps without any restriction. Special optimization functions support the dimming of the majority of dimmable LED lights and Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs). The device is IP20 rated and can therefore only be used in dry environments. The device offers a Baby-Dim Function which dims down a lamp from a defined level into another defined level in a longer but also definable period (e.g. 20 minutes). An automatic Light-Off function and programmable dimming and switching behavior makes the device a very flexible tool for inhouse lighting.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"123580","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":38,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":263,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":261,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":262,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":270,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":264,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":258,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":257,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":265,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":267,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":260,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":259,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":266,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Set LED indication mode","description":"","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":1,"minimum":0,"maximum":3,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1572,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":2299},{"value":1,"label":"On when switch on","id":2300},{"value":2,"label":"On when switch off","id":2301},{"value":3,"label":"Operated by command","id":2302}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Automatic switch off time","description":"If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time (in seconds)","units":"","overview":"","size":2,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":65535,"read_only":"","write_only":"","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1573,"options":[]},{"param_id":3,"label":"RF Off command","description":"RF Off command","units":"","overview":"<p>Defines how to interpret RF Off command.
