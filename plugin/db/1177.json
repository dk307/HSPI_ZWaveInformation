It may be connected to two-wire or three-wire configuration so it can operate with or without neutral lead. The dimmer can switch or dim connected light source either through Z-Wave devices or through the rotary knob directly. The smart dimmer is equipped with an algorithm of smart light source detection which makes configuration easier and ensures high compatibility of the device. It may be used as a switch with non-dimmable light sources (in 3-wire connection).<\/p> <p>Main Features:<\/p> <ul><li>Advanced microprocessor control,<\/li> <li>Implemented algorithm of smart light source detection,<\/li> <li>Auto-adjustment of the appropriate control mode to connected load,<\/li> <li>Active power and energy metering functionality,<\/li> <li>Soft start function,<\/li> <li>Memory
