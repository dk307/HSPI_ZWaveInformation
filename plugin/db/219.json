The system allows trigger conditions to be set based on the input voltage being inside or outside a user-defined range (configured via Z-Wave). \u00a0This provides great flexibility for capturing events in a wide variety of applications. The trigger status of the input can be read via Z-WaveTM and\/or can be automatically sent to a configured node, typically the Controller. \u00a0In addition, a count of the trigger events that have occurred for the input channel is internally recorded (and stored in the \u2018pulse count\u2019) and is available to be requested or automatically sent via Z-Wave. \u00a0The current triggered\/un-triggered status can also be read via ZWave.<\/p> <p>The SIG1 input can be associated with up to two other Z-WaveTM devices, such that an associated device will automatically turn on (or off) based on the occurrence of a trigger event. \u00a0Finally, the analog input channel can be configured so that the analog input level (not just binary trigger status) is periodically sent to up to two other associated nodes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The output relay is typically commanded via Z-WaveTM commands. In addition, the user can configure the input SIG1 trigger condition to be mapped to the output relay. \u00a0For example, Relay 1 can be automatically turned on based on Input SIG1 being triggered. \u00a0The relay activation can be set via a jumper or via Z-WaveTM for either momentary or latched operation.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"mimolite","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":38,"label":"FortrezZ LLC","reference":132,"uuid":"fortrezz","url":""},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":314,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":null,"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":2472,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2475,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2470,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":731,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2469,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":730,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2467,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_general","config":"type=GENERAL","label":"Sensor (general)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":729,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2468,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2476,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_general","config":"","label":"Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":732,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2473,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2471,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2474,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":2,"label":"Clear_Pulse_Meter_Counts","description":"","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1509,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Clear Pulse Meter Counts","id":2231}]},{"param_id":3,"label":"Trigger_Mapping","description":"Input-to-relay Mapping","units":"","overview":"<p>The MIMOlite can be configured to automatically turn the relay on when the input is triggered or a Z-Wave command can also turn the relay on.

When input-to-relay mapping is enabled, Z-WaveTM commands to set the relay are overridden. The default for the relay is no input-to-relay mapping. Momentary vs Latched relay operation is selected by jumper P5 on the circuit board. The Momentary\/Latched jumper is read only at power on when the MIMOlite is not in a ZWave network. When the jumper is off, momentary (default 500ms) operation is selected. If desired, once in-network, a Zwave configuration command (Parameter 11) can be used to override the jumper setting. The momentary configuration can be set from 100ms to 25.5ms (approximate) in increments of 100ms via the ZWave command.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Note that neither a Basic Report nor a Binary Switch Report is sent when relay is automatically set or cleared by Trigger Mapping.<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1510,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":2232},{"value":1,"label":"SIG1 triggered\/untriggered sets or clears Relay1","id":2233}]},{"param_id":4,"label":"Lower_Threshold_High","description":"Lower Threshold, High","units":"","overview":"<p>Lower Threshold, High (Default=0xBB; must be less than Upper Threshold Low and greater than Lower Threshold Low).<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":187,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1511,"options":[{"value":187,"label":"Default (0xBB)","id":2234}]},{"param_id":5,"label":"Lower_Threshold_Low","description":"Lower Threshold, Low","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":171,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1512,"options":[{"value":171,"label":"Default (0xAB)","id":2235}]},{"param_id":6,"label":"Upper_Threshold_High","description":"Upper Threshold, High","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":255,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1513,"options":[{"value":255,"label":"Default (0xFF)","id":2236}]},{"param_id":7,"label":"Upper_Threshold_Low","description":"Upper Threshold, Low","units":"","overview":"<p>Upper Threshold, Low (Default = 0xFE; must be greater than Lower Threshold High and less than Upper Threshold High).<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":254,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1514,"options":[{"value":254,"label":"Default (0xFE)","id":2237}]},{"param_id":8,"label":"Trigger_Level_And_Input_Threshold","description":"","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":3,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"","write_only":"","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1515,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"ANALOG, trigger OUTSIDE of thresholds.","id":2238},{"value":1,"label":"ANALOG, trigger BETWEEN thresholds.","id":2239},{"value":2,"label":"DIGITAL, trigger OUTSIDE of thresholds.","id":2240},{"value":3,"label":"DIGITAL, trigger BETWEEN thresholds.","id":2241}]},{"param_id":9,"label":"Multilevel_AutoReport_Interval","description":"Multilevel AutoReport Interval","units":"","overview":"<p>Periodic send interval of Multilevel Sensor Reports (Association Group 2) and\/or Pulse Count Reports (Association Group 5) for SIG1.
