Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.<\/p> <p>2. Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by inserting the battery. When the inclusion process is complete the red LED will turn on for approximately 10 seconds and then it will go out. If the LED continues to flash, repeat the inclusion process.<\/p> <p>3. Test the garage door sensor before mounting it. Hold the sensor in your hand. Flip the sensor upside-down and watch the LED while doing so. The LED will flash each time the position of the sensor is changed. If your Z- Wave network has a software interface you may verify that the messages from the sensor are being received each time the sensor is flipped.<\/p> <p>If you need to repeat the inclusion process, repeat STEP ONE above, then for STEP TWO you will need to simply remove the cover of the sensor, remove the battery for 5 seconds, reinsert the battery, and replace the sensor cover. This will re-enter the sensor in inclusion mode.<\/p>","label":"TILT-ZWAVE2.5-ECO","last_approval_time":"2020-07-29 21:02:32","listening":"0","overview":"<ul><li>Z-Wave PlusTM enabled device which transmits when a garage door is opened or closed<\/li> <li>Uses a tilt sensor to detect the angle of a door and transmits open\/closed status<\/li> <li>Reports tamper condition if cover is removed\u00a0<\/li> <\/ul>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"tiltzwave25","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>To save power, this sensor sleeps most of the time and is therefore not awake to receive messages from a gateway for testing.
