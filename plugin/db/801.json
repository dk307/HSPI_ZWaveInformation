Press the\u00a0On\/Off\u00a0button over 3 seconds and release it before the 6th\u00a0second, the roller shutter controller will start the shutter calibration process. The\u00a0process is composed of three continue stages. The shutter move to the BOTTOM\u00a0in first stage, and move to the TOP in second stage, and move to the BOTTOM\u00a0again in\u00a01-second intervals\u00a0third stage.
