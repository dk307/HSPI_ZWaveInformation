Thus, your SwiidPlug\u2122 can respond directly to a signal from another Z-Wave\u00ae device in your network, such as the triggering of a presence detector. As soon as it has been plugged into a mains socket, the SwiidPlug\u2122 can be included into a Z-Wave\u00ae network so as to interoperate with controllers and other Z-Wave\u00ae devices. <\/p>","protocol_version":"1.210","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"swiidplug","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":11,"label":"Reitz-Group.de","reference":100,"uuid":"reitz","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":187,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":1331,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1329,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1332,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":444,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":1326,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14513,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1327,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1328,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1330,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_HAIL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14512,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1333,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":1334,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Switch All","description":"Switch All","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":5957,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":8384},{"value":255,"label":"Enabled","id":8385}]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Group 1","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1955}],"documents":[{"id":828,"file":"ZAP-User-s-manual-vBAT-30-11-2014.pdf","label":"User manual"},{"id":829,"file":"advanced-swiidplug.pdf","label":"advanced-swiidplug"},{"id":1972,"file":"swiid.png","label":"Image"}]}
