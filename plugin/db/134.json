The device can be hard wired (12 or 24 VDC) or battery operated (battery life 3 years*). Smoke detection is signaled through siren and LED diode blinking. Additionally, the smoke sensor signal can be sent to an alarm system or fire alarm system hub, through a NC (normally closed) contact terminals.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The optical sensor detects smoke at an early stage of fire, often before flames appear and temperature starts to rise significantly. Moreover the device has a built-in temperature sensor, which can also trigger the alarm once the specified temperatute threshold is exceeded.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Fibaro Smoke Sensor is designed to be placed on a wall or ceiling. LED indicator signals fire, operating mode and used to see if device is within the Z-Wave network. The smoke sensor is designed to operate in confined spaces, under normal conditions (lacking smoke, dust, condensed water vapor)<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.067","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"fgss001","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>If the sensor is already included in the Z-Wave network, wake it up by triple clicking the B-button..<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":18,"label":"Fibargroup","reference":271,"uuid":"fibaro","url":"http:\/\/www.fibaro.com\/"},"category":{"id":20,"label":"Smoke Detector","category":"SmokeDetector","description":"Smoke detectors"},"endpoints":[{"id":23,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":161,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_ALARM"},"specific_class":{"id":2,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_ALARM_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":148,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":139,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":140,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":56,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":147,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CRC_16_ENCAP","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":146,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":142,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":144,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":143,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":138,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":145,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2535,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_TIME_PARAMETERS","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[{"name":"time_offset","config":"","label":"Clock Time Offset","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":746,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":141,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_ALARM","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_smoke","config":"type=SMOKE","label":"Alarm (smoke)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":57,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_general","config":"type=GENERAL","label":"Alarm (general)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":58,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_heat","config":"type=HEAT","label":"Alarm (heat)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":59,"options":[]}]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Alarm Cancellation Delay","description":"Alarm Cancellation Delay","units":"","overview":"<p>Additional delay after an alarm has ceased.
