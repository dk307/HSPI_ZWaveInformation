The thermostat has 2 internal temperature sensors and has 3 algorithms for temperature compensation. After you have set the temperature, the thermostat will use a hysteresis to regulate the temperature. The hysteresis is adjustable.<\/p> <p>The temperature shown in the display is the actual temperature for floor sensor and the external room sensor. You are able to calibrate the sensor values. When using the internal room sensor, the temperature shown is the set point. When using the internal sensor, the thermostat can seem somewhat inaccurate. This is due to heat generation inside the thermostat, draft and other external influences.<\/p> <p>1.92 is an unofficial firmware upgrade with the following changes:<\/p> <p>* Reporting of the relay status is fixed.<\/p> <p>* All temperature sensors can be reported (internal, floor, external) via its association groups<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.061","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"tf016","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"1.092","wakeup":"<p>Not applicable<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":53,"label":"ThermoFloor","reference":411,"uuid":"thermofloor","url":""},"category":{"id":9,"label":"HVAC","category":"HVAC","description":"Air condition devices, Fans"},"endpoints":[{"id":1333,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":8,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_THERMOSTAT"},"specific_class":{"id":6,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_THERMOSTAT_GENERAL_V2"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":12655,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12653,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12652,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"<p>This switch turns off the device.
