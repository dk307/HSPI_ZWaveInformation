The In-wall switch can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.<\/p><p>This device supports the SmartStart inclusion. SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave network by scanning the Z-Wave QR Code present on the product with a controller providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required and the SmartStart product will be added automatically within a period after the QR code being scanned or reset power of the device. Please find the QR code on the device casing.<\/p><p>The encryption mode that the switch supports is S2 Unauthenticated. When the switch is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller\/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration). The switch supports OTA and can update firmware wirelessly. In addition, the switch is equipped with Power Metering and over current protection.<br><\/p><p>Z-Wave Frequency\t.\t868 42 MHZ (EU)<\/p><p>Input Voltage\tAC100-240V<\/p><p>Output

convention.&nbsp; However the external switch\/switches are wired using a neutral circuit.&nbsp; This means care has to be taken when adding to a new location where a standard wall switch has been installed as they will be within the live circuit.<\/li><li>The connections to the inbuilt relay need 2 live feeds to be wired in and 2 live feeds out.&nbsp; This means there are a lot of live connections to be made.&nbsp; As the unit is not the smallest take care re the depth of the backbox and\/or consider using Wago connectors as they take up very little space.<\/li><\/ol>","uuid":"highloadswitch","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Not
