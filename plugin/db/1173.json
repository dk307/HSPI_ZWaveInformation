Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product\u2019s firmware upgrade.<\/p> <p>The remote control has following functions:<\/p> <ol><li>Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF' and Dim commands.<\/li> <li>Activation of scenes in Gateway mode. <\/li> <\/ol><p>The encryption modes that the remote control supports are S0, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the remote control is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption.
