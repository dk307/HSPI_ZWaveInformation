It features a PIR sensor to detect motion through movement of heat sources and a LUX sensor for determining brightness of its surroundings. It is equipped with Z-Wave Plus wireless communication capability that will convert an ordinary motion-activated floodlight into a smart home device.<\/p> <p><strong>Conventional Floodlight Mode<\/strong> HS-FLS100+ can be used as a conventional motion-activated floodlight sensor to power floodlights when motion is sensed during dark hours. Controls are provided for manual adjustment of LUX sensitivity and floodlight ON times.<\/p> <p><strong>Smart Floodlight Mode<\/strong> When added to a smart home system, HS-FLS100+ will send Z-Wave commands to the smart hub or home controller when motion is sensed and when the LUX level changes. Likewise, the smart hub or home controller can send Z-Wave commands back to the HS-FLS100+ to turn floodlights ON and OFF. This added functionality provides a very high level of flexibility not typically available in conventional motion-activated floodlights.<\/p> <p><strong>Smart Sensor Mode<\/strong> HS-FLS100+ can be installed and used simply as an outdoor motion and LUX sensor. Floodlight functionality is not required. This provides some interesting security and smart home possibilities!<\/p>","protocol_version":"5.003","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"hsfls100","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":69,"label":"HomeSeer
