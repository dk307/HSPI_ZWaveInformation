And if the illumination is changed to plus or minus the value (setting by the configuration NO.22), the device will report illumination information to the nodes in the group 1.<\/p> <p>Caution 1: Enable this function will reduce the battery life about 15% ~ 20%. And another issue is setting the differential value too small, it will cause report too frequency, shorter the battery life more.<\/p> <p>Propose the setting differential value should not small than 10.<\/p> <p>Caution 2: If the configuration No.4 is setting to 0 or 100, this functionality is useless.<\/p> <p>Caution 3: Enable this functionality, it will cause the PIR Motion to disable detection when the illumination measurement. In other words,<\/p> <p>The PIR motion will blind one second in every one minute.<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":1,"minimum":0,"maximum":99,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":1168,"options":[]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Reports","max_nodes":8,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":294},{"group_id":2,"label":"Light Control","max_nodes":8,"controller":"0","description":"","overview":"","id":295}],"documents":[{"id":352,"file":"PST02-Manual-2014-09-17.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":2116,"file":"PST02-A.jpg","label":"Image"}]}
