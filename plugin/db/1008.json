Furthermore, it protects appliances from eventual overload. A very innovative design, which integrates a complex system that allows a precise energy consumption monitoring. The integration of these features in its very small size product, make it unique on the market.<\/p> <p>The device is equipped with contact protection technology (<i>Zero Crossing<\/i>) which reduces the electrical stress on the relay contacts and ensures a longer life. The open \/ closed switching of the device always occur when the instantaneous value of voltage is 0.<\/p> <p>It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave\/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, WiDom Smart Plug will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.400","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"wsp1","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":52,"label":"wiDom","reference":329,"uuid":"widom","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power
