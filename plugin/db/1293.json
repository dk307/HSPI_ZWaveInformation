It can be used in various home applications. You can get the information about consumed water on one side or have the complete protection of your home water system with water metering, flood detection and actuator for opening and closing the valve accordingly. It is perfectly suitable for garden\/lawn irrigation, where you can set the manual operation, automatic operation with timer or based on humidity sensor. In case you have two water sources, public distribution system and own water tank, you can decide when, how and which one to use to reduce water costs and water
