Z-WaveTM enabled devices displaying the Z-WaveTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-WaveTM enabled networks. Inclusion of this detector on other manufacturer\u2019s Wireless Controller menu allows remote operation of connected modules when the detector is triggered.<\/p> <p>The Temperature\/Humidity Detector is designed to monitor the current temperature and humidity of ambient environment. The reading of temperature\/humidity can be reported to you on a regular base at your disposal. If temperature\/humidity reaches set points, the detector will send alerts to associated devices for further execution. Since sudden temperature\/humidity change may cause health problems to people such as elderly or very young children, Temp.\/Humid. Detector provides you most up-to-date temperature and humidity reading for you to watch your family\u2019s health.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.028","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"st814","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<ul><li>Pressing key 3 times within 1.5 seconds will\u00a0wake the device<\/li> <\/ul>","manufacturer":{"id":8,"label":"Everspring","reference":96,"uuid":"everspring","url":""},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":56,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":33,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":415,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":416,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Switch","overview":"<p>This channel will be set to ON when the temperature or humidity level in configuration parameters 2 and 4 are reached.
