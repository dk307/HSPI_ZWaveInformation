This sensor doesn't emitany energy but only passively receive and detect infrared radiation from outside. Under roomtemperature, all items have radiation. Human beings are warm-blooded animals with stableinfrared radiation, so are most easily to be detected. That's why we also call it body sensor.PIR send messages via Z-Wave network to Z-Wave gateway. In the Z-Wavenetwork communications, PIR can be connected to any Z-Wave gateway. Different countriesor areas, the radio frequency is different. In the communication between PIR and Z-Wave gatwway, PIR can only send messages, not be able to receive messages. When PIR istriggered, PIR will send message to Z-Wave gateway, and associate devices to work throughZWave gateway. PIR is battery powered, is small and can be installed easily.<br><\/p>","protocol_version":"6.002","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"neomotion","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":82,"label":"Shenzhen Neo Electronics Co., Ltd","reference":600,"uuid":"shenzhen","url":"http:\/\/www.szneo.com\/"},"category":{"id":1,"label":"Battery","category":"Battery","description":"Batteries, Energy Storages"},"endpoints":[{"id":2076,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":20465,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20464,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5784,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":20456,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":7,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5782,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_luminance","config":"type=LUMINANCE","label":"Sensor (luminance)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5783,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":20468,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_TRANSPORT_SERVICE","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20458,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20457,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20462,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20469,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SUPERVISION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20460,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20452,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":8,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_burglar","config":"type=BURGLAR","label":"Alarm (burglar)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5781,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":20461,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20454,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20466,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20459,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20455,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20463,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20453,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":20467,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY_2","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Sensitivity Level Setting","description":"","units":"","overview":"<p >This parameter defines the sensitivity of PIR sensor.
