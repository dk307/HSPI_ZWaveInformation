Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Nano Shutter.<\/p> <p>The wireless module is powered from the mains supply. In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the units operating status.<\/p> <p>Nano Shutter is also a security Z-Wave plus device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.<\/p> <p>It can be a repeater in the Z-Wave network. Acting as a bridge for communication, it will forward Z-Wave command messages to their destinations if the originating controller is out of range from the destination node.\u00a0<br \/><br \/><\/p>","protocol_version":"5.003","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Controlling the Nano Shutter.<\/p> <ul><li>Use any of the below methods to control the Nano Shutter.<\/li> <li>Pressing the button on the external (Wall) switch will be able to spin the motor up\/down\/stop through the usage of Z-Wave commands built into Z-Wave certified controllers and gateways (The specific Z-Wave commands supporting this function are the Basic Command Class and Multilevel Switch Command Class.)
