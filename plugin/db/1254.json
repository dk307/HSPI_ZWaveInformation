Although it is controlling other devices. the device Cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.<\/p> <p>The remote control has following functions:<\/p> <ol><li>Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON'. 'OFF' and Dim commands.<\/li> <li>Activation of scenes in Gateway mode.<\/li> <\/ol><p>The encryption modes that the remote control supports are SO, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the remote control is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller\/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).<\/p>","protocol_version":"5.003","routing":"1","usage":"<p><strong>Set and unset associations:<\/strong><\/p> <p>(Note: All association information will be cleared automatically once the remote control is excluded from a network.)<\/p> <p>There are two methods to set associations:<\/p> <p>1. Set association by operating primary controller\/gateway to send association command to the remote control<\/p> <p>When set association from primary controller\/gateway, the remote control shall be activated first, if it is not activated. you should activate it manually.<\/p> <p>The primary controller\/gateway sends association command to the remote control using 'Command Class ASSOCIATION' or 'Command Class Multi ChannelAssociation'<\/p> <p>2. Set association by operating the remote control and devices to be controlled:<\/p> <p>To control a Z-Wave device from the remote control, the node ID of this device needs to be assigned to one of the two association groups.

Short press ON button of any group within 7s to associate the device to this group, short press OFF button 01 any group within 7s to remove association of the device from this group.<\/p> <p>3.
