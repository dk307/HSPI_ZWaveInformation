Beside this, the device can directly control groups of other Z-Wave devices on over- and undershooting a set temperature and\/or humidity parameter. This can be used to establish control loops for temperature and humidity. The device wakes up every 4 minutes to measure the values and it will send unsolicited reports when values change. Additionally, the device will report all values on request.<br \/>The mold detector is actively monitoring the danger of mold in a room based on the temperature and humidity and will issue alarm warnings when critical air conditions met. Wireless Alarm and red and a green blinking LED will indicate a mold condition. This local LED warning function is also available when the device is not included in any Z-Wave network and works stand alone.<\/p> <p>The POPP Mold Detector can be mounted in two ways.<\/p> <ol><li>use the enclosed adhesive tape.

It contains information about the device type and the technical capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame. Beside this it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. To issue a NIF execute the following action: Tripple Click the tamper button<\/p>","uuid":"pope701202","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<h1>Communication to a Sleeping device (Wakeup)<\/h1> <p><strong>A triple click (3 cliecks) on the tamper button will wakeup the device<\/strong>.<\/p> <p><br \/>This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time. Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller C is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store commands that can not be received during deep sleep state. Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and\/or the battery life time is significantly decreased.<br \/><br \/>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification. The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal battery life time and the desired responses of the device.
