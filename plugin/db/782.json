The sensors are battery-operated devices which transmit information to an associated device in a network. It can support either 1 thermistor (SES 001) or up to 4 external digital temperature sensors (SES 002\/003). SES 303 operates on 2x AA batteries, providing a nominal life of 2 years (with on-board sensors operating with the default configuration).<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.095","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"ses303","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Device can be wakeup by button press of more then one second, devcie will stay in wakeup state for about 10 seconds<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":7,"label":"Horstmann Controls Limited","reference":89,"uuid":"horstmann","url":""},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":1103,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":33,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":10327,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10330,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10328,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":6,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2989,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_relhumidity","config":"type=RELATIVE_HUMIDITY","label":"Sensor (relative humidity)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2990,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":10324,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10331,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10325,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10322,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10326,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10323,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10321,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10333,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10329,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10332,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Delta Temp","description":"Precision of measured temperature (delta)","units":"Celcius degrees","overview":"<p>Configuration value : Desired value \/ Resolution.
