Z-Wave PlusTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave PlusTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-WaveTM enabled networks. Remote On\/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer\u2019s wireless Controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. Because PAN15 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device.<\/p><p ><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">This plug-in ON\/OFF switch is able to detect instance wattage (1560W\/UL\/TW\/JP) and overload current (14.5A) of connected lights or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Switch will be disabled and its On\/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly. However, unplug and re-connect the switch will reset its overload condition to normal status.<\/span><\/p><p>Adding to Z-WaveTM Network<\/p><p>In the front casing, there is an On\/Off button with LED indicator which is used to toggle switch on and off or carry out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association. When first power is applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals. It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion.<\/p><p>Auto Inclusion<\/p><p>The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the switch does not have Node ID and just plug the switch into a wall outlet.<\/p><p>Note: Auto inclusion timeout is 2 minute during which the node information of explorer frame will be emitted once several seconds. Unlike \u201cinclusion\u201d function as shown in the table below, the execution of auto inclusion is free from pressing the On\/Off button on the Switch.<\/p><p>The table below lists an operation summary of basic Z-Wave functions. Please refer to the instructions for your Z-WaveTM Certificated Primary Controller to access the Setup function, and to include\/exclude\/associate
