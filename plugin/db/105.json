Special Design can fit most of door\/window frame. The primary sensing element is a magnetic reed switch, the ZD2102 is supplied with the sensor, sensor mounting bracket and the trigger magnet. An additional set of sensor inputs are provided through a 2 position screw terminal and can be used to expand the sensor capability to multiple inputs. The ZD2102 is powered by a single CR123A Lithium Battery (supplied with unit, battery life is more than 5 years) and is intended for indoor use only. The ZD2102 features tamper proof switch, low battery warning and can be firmware updated over the air.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"zd2102","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Open the rear cover<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":17,"label":"Vision Security","reference":265,"uuid":"vision","url":"http:\/\/www.visionsecurity.com.tw\/"},"category":{"id":6,"label":"Door","category":"Door","description":"Door sensors"},"endpoints":[{"id":33,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3817,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":206,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":10387,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_door","config":"","label":"Sensor (Binary)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3005,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":208,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_tamper","config":"type=BURGLAR, event=3","label":"Tamper Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":73,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_entry","config":"type=ACCESS_CONTROL, event=2","label":"Sensor (Alarm)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":701,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":200,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":204,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":202,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":205,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":201,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Control Command","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":152}],"documents":[{"id":18,"file":"ZD-2102-04162014.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":795,"file":"vision-security-door-window-sensor-z-wave-zd2102-5.jpg","label":"Product Image"},{"id":3382,"file":"ZD_2102_10252013.pdf","label":"ZD 2102 Manual"},{"id":3383,"file":"ZD_2102_1.pdf","label":"ZD 2102 Manual"}]}
