The&nbsp;device is delivered as a complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching&nbsp;series DURO 2000 SI in color pearl white from Busch Jaeger. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be&nbsp;configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the motor control is indicated on a dual color LED for test&nbsp;purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. The function of the local paddle can be&nbsp;configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the local actuator is&nbsp;controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.<\/p>","protocol_version":"2.051","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"06436","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":22,"label":"Z-Wave.Me","reference":277,"uuid":"zwaveme","url":""},"category":{"id":2,"label":"Blinds","category":"Blinds","description":"Roller shutters, window blinds, etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":350,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":3,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_MOTOR_MULTIPOSITION"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":2859,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2857,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2850,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":808,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2849,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"blinds_control","config":"","label":"Blinds Control","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":807,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2854,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2851,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2858,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2852,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2860,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_HAIL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2856,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2853,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2855,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"LED mode","description":"Set LED indication mode","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":3,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2789,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":3869},{"value":1,"label":"Show working state","id":3870},{"value":2,"label":"Show idle state","id":3871},{"value":3,"label":"Operated by Indicator Command Class","id":3872},{"value":4,"label":"Show if not closed","id":3873}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Automatically open or close after","description":"Automatically open or close blind after time","units":"Seconds","overview":"<p>If not zero, automatically open or close blind after a user defined time<\/p>","size":2,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":65535,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2790,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":3874}]},{"param_id":3,"label":"What to do on RF close command","description":"Defines how to interpret RF Off command.","units":"","overview":"Defines how to interpret RF Off command.
