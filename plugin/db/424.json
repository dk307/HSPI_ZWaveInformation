The smoke detector is certified by the VdS for Q quality and DIN EN 14604 and satisfies all contemporary legal requirements.<\/p> <p>The High-End 10 years smoke detector offers a test button conveniently accessible even with a broomstick when mounted on the sealing. The smoke chamber is monitored electronically to avoid any malfunction and wrong alerts. The device will also report its end of life to make sure it is getting replaced on time.<\/p> <p>According to the VdS 3515 (smoke sensors with radio communication) this device will relay all alarms to all other smoke sensors in the Z-Wave network to create a house-wide alarm. This connection of the smoke sensors is fully automated and needs no further configuration. The smoke sensors and the controller communicate via a secure protocol to prevent manipulation.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"009402","version_max":"1.001","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":20,"label":"Smoke Detector","category":"SmokeDetector","description":"Smoke detectors"},"endpoints":[{"id":487,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":4155,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4159,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4152,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1203,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4160,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1205,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4156,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4154,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_smoke","config":"type=SMOKE","label":"Smoke Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1204,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4151,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4158,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4153,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4157,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Siren alarm sequence interval","description":"Siren alarm sequence interval","units":"","overview":"<p>The additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm.
