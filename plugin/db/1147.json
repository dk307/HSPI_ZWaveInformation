In the Z-Wave network communications, light switch can be connected to any Z-Wave gateway. When using radio waves, light switch can be used in conjunction with Z-Wave gateway. The frequency of radio waves used by gateway and switch is like this: different countries or areas, the radio frequency is different. Each light switch has a unique ID code. When we add or remove the switch from the alarm host, just place light switch in the Z-Wave network range of gateway. Then we can easily find the switch through the device ID code. In communication with gateway, light switch not only can send signals to Z-Wave gateway, but also can receive signals from it. When touch the button on light switch, it would send signals to Z-Wave gateway, then gateway can correctly display the switch on \/ off state; when light switch receives signals from gateway, the switch state would be remotely switched on\/off.<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.004","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"eu3","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":82,"label":"Shenzhen
