This ensures that all information has been removed from your Primary Programmer\/Remote\u2019s information table and is not counted on to be a part of the mesh network.<\/p> <p>A) If using a Leviton Z-Wave\u00ae Programmer\/Remote, Cat. No. VRCPG, press the Menu button and scroll down to System Setup. Press the center button to select System Setup Menu. Choose Advanced Settings. Press the center button to select Network.<\/p> <p>B) While standing close to the module, press the center button to &lt;Exclude&gt; device from the network.<\/p> <p>NOTE: Only one device may be excluded at a time.<\/p> <p>C) While the Programmer\/Remote is in the Exclusion mode and the LED is ON on the Scene Capable Plug-In Lamp Dimming Module, press the ON\/OFF button on the module. The Programmer\/Remote will verify Exclusion and the LED will turn OFF on the Scene Capable Plug-In Lamp Dimming Module. If the Scene Capable Plug-In Lamp Dimming Module is flashing Amber while in the Exclusion mode, the Programmer\/Remote is still trying to communicate with the module. Wait until the device stops flashing, then press the ON\/OFF button.<\/p> <p>Factory Default:<\/p> <p>If your module is not responding, or you are unable to control it after you have tried to Include\/Exclude it multiple times, it may be necessary to reset the module to its original factory settings. To accomplish this, proceed as follows: \u2022 Unplug the module and wait 5 seconds. Plug the module back in and within 20 seconds press and hold the programming button until the LED turns Amber and then turns Red. The module is now reset. Once the module is reset, it will be necessary to Re-Include it to a network before it can be used.<\/p> <p>CAUTION: SETTING A DEVICE TO A FACTORY DEFAULT DOES NOT EXCLUDE THAT DEVICE FROM A NETWORK. THE EXCLUSION PROCEDURE MUST STILL BE FOLLOWED TO REMOVE THE DEVICE FROM THE PRIMARY REMOTE\u2019S INFORMATION TABLE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN SYSTEM THAT IS SLOW TO RESPOND, ORMAY FAIL TO RESPOND TO SOME DEVICES.<\/p>","first_approval_time":"2016-10-13 07:23:46","frequently_listening":"0","inclusion":"<ul><li>If using a non-Leviton Programmer\/Remote, refer to the Programmer\/Remote instruction sheet for Including a device.<\/li> <li>If using the VRCPG's Install Checklist feature, go directly to Step B.<\/li> <\/ul><p>A) If using a Leviton Z-Wave\u00ae Programmer\/Remote, Cat.
