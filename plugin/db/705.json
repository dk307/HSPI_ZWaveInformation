Its value also extends beyond today, it has permanency and constancy. The L 810 iHF outdoor SensorLight is an LED uplight and downlight that translates intelligent technology into form and function. For the first time, we have managed to make a light's sensor completely invisible \u2013 without compromising on first-class design and technological perfection. For stunning upward and downward lighting. New: optional manual override for 4 hours.<br \/><br \/>The optional Smart Friends box and the free Smart Friends app make it easy to set the L 810 LED iHF Z-Wave via smart phone or tablet. The light can also be switched ON or OFF via app. Other Steinel products can also be interconnected. If you wish, this also works via remote control when you are out. That completes your own light management

BASIC_SET and similar Z-Wave commands are not retransmitted intentionally to slaves and must be sent to slave devices via the controlling device simultaneously. Only for use in master-slave system, multi-device control is not possible. Group 2 is evaluated and frames are transmitted there also in SLAVE_ MODE, regardless of LOCAL_DISABLED state and when MOTION_ENABLE is off (not using internal motion sensor, just reacting to remote motion events in this case). If multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor endpoint.<\/p>","id":1210},{"group_id":3,"label":"Notification: Motion","max_nodes":16,"controller":"1","description":"Motion Begin\/End (PIR\/radar\/iHF)","overview":"<p>Group 3 sends MOTION_BEGIN and MOTION_END frames.

Frames are sent a maximum of once per 2.5 minutes and a minimum of once per 15 minutes. When device already uses remote Ambient Light value, then this value is also retransmitted to group 4. All devices in such a group should have the same LIGHT (threshold) settings in order that night mode is detected at the same time.
