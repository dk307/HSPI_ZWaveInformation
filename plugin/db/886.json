Heatit Z-Water is a module that clips right onto a DIN rail to add a variety of functions to your wireless Z-Wave network. <br \/>Heatit Z-Water is equipped with 10 relay outputs and it has 4 analog\/digital inputs. The module can be power supplied from a 230V AC mains connection, and is able to deliver an output supply of 24V DC or 230V. Heatit Z-Water relay outputs are able to be freely controlled from the Z-Wave network, and can be used for several purposes, e.g. on\/off control of light, control of valve actuators for an underfloor heating system, or control of other home automation systems.<\/p> <p>Heatit Z-Water analog\/digital inputs (different firmware versions) can be configured to work with different functionality and can be connected to potential free contacts, open-collector outputs, and will be able to control other Z-Wave devices; switches, dimmers, etc. Furthermore, the inputs can be used as a Scene Controller and send Central Scene notifications to the Z-Wave gateway.<br \/>It is possible to configure the level and the indication of the status indicator LED in the front of the Heatit Z-Water module.<\/p>","uuid":"zwater","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>NA<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":53,"label":"ThermoFloor","reference":411,"uuid":"thermofloor","url":""},"category":{"id":9,"label":"HVAC","category":"HVAC","description":"Air
