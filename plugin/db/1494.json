Of the Simon 100 series comes this Module Master iO. A switch master as it allows you to activate the functionalities to press the mechanism of natural way, in the same way as with any other device. This type of switches are also unify tasks by adding, in the same way, solutions according to the needs of each. Compatible with elements up to 16 Ampere current and 250 Volt voltage. This Simon 100 is the first series to incorporate the iO Simon system, being the switches in operation analog to digital. Thanks to this, it is possible to connect all types of devices, giving the spaces a greater comfort, more functionality and also a better appearance. A simple, comfortable and user-friendly, which saves time to the user. Master compatible with Simon 100 series frames.<br><\/p><p>Roller Blind IO is ready to operate with Z-Wave controllers and configured to be managed by Simon100 IO APP using the HUB plug IO for getting a better user experience.
