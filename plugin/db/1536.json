Z-Wave PlusTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave PlusTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-WaveTM enabled networks. Remote On\/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer\u2019s wireless Controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. <br><br>Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. Because NQ-9770 (labeled as PAN03) supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller.
