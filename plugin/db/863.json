With its small size and clean design, it fits into your home interior design very well also it is possible to use two devices side by side in most electrical outlets. LED indicator can be turned off to not disturb in dark rooms. Control lighting, chargers and other electronic equipment up to 2300 W (resistive load).<\/p> <p>With energy consumption measuring you don\u2019t only see the actual consumption, it can also help to find out if your connected device is ok or not or turn off the mobile charger when the mobile phone is fully charged for safe operation.<\/p> <p>The device acts as a repeater for the Z-Wave
