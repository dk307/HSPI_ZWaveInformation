E.g. in case of danger, the escape routes can be perfectly illuminated by scene control. And if you are not at home, you can credibly simulate your presence by configuring scenarios. When it comes to comfort, you make no compromises compared to a 60W light bulb, with significantly lower power consumption. The LED lamp produces warm white light (2700k), is dimmable and fits into any conventional E27 socket.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.038","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"shlm10010","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":693,"label":"ABUS Security-Center GmbH & Co.
