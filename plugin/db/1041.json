The lock allows the user (through a third-party smart home controller) to remotely check the door lock status, lock or unlock the door and receive notifications. The SmartCode lever is a one-touch locking motorized lever. With your personalized code, you can enter your home with the convenience of keyless entry and the back-lit keypad provides increased visibility. SmartCode is easy to install, program and use, and operates on 4 AA batteries. It also features SmartKey Security as the back-up
