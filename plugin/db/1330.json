It is compatible with existing FUGA\u00ae frames and wall boxes.<\/p><p >MATRIX ZBA has four configurable pushbuttons that can control other Z-Wave devices through the wireless Z-Wave network. These buttons can send \u2018ON\u2019, \u2018OFF\u2019 and \u2018DIM\u2019 commands to the associated Z-Wave devices. These devices could be light dimmers, blinds, sunscreens, etc.<\/p><p >MATRIX ZBA can also issue scene activation commands that can be used to activate scenes in the Z-Wave Controller.<\/p><p >MATRIX ZBA has four RGB indicator LEDs, one for each pushbutton, that indicates activation of the pushbutton, and when MATRIX ZBA is in inclusion or exclusion mode. These indicators can be configured to a desired indication colour, or they can indicate the battery level when a pushbutton is activated.<\/p><p >MATRIX ZBA is equipped with the newest battery-saving 700-series Z-Wave chip that uses up to 65% less power and have improved wireless range. This means that the small coin-cell battery can last between 5 \u201310years.<\/p><p >MATRIX ZBA is estimated to have a battery lifetime, at normal use, to approximately 5 years.<\/p>","protocol_version":"7.013","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"matrixzba7140","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p >This device will wake up every 6 hours and announce the wake-upstate by sending out a so-called Wake Up Notification.
