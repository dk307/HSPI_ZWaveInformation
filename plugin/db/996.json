The device supports both the Network Wide Inclusion mechanism (which offers the ability to be included in a network, even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and Normal Inclusion. By default, the inclusion procedure starts in Normal Inclusion mode and after a short time out the procedure continues in Network Wide Inclusion mode that lasts for about 20 Seconds.<\/p> <p>Before including the device the LED status indicator is solid RED. The procedure of inclusion is activated by clicking Add in the inclusion interface and by pressing any sequence of click on the integrated button. As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks.
