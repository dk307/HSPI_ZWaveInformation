It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group.<\/p> <p>It is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with single color z wave device SR-ZV9101FA-DIM and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions.
