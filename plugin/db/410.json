It is called a Tag Reader because it uses RFID Tags to identify people and their personal preferences around leaving the house or coming home.<\/p> <p>Separately from working with RFID Tags, the Tag Reader also has a numerical keypad. Within the free of charge online manager you can configure a numerical code. This way you prevent being locked out of the system in case you may have lost the RFID Tag.<\/p> <p>By using the Tag Reader intelligently you can secure your house and save money on your energy bill at the same time. You can actually let your house \u2018fall asleep\u2019 when enabling the \u2018Away Scene\u2019.
