Z-WaveTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-Wave enabled networks. Inclusion of this unit on other manufacturer\u2019s Wireless Controller menu allows remote operation of the unit and the connected load. The On\/Off Mini Plug is designed to control the on\/off status of appliances load in your house. At 220-240V voltage, this Plug can support up to 1500W resistive.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.095","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Under normal operation mode, press the on\/off button on the unit to control the on\/off status of the connected load. When power is on, the LED indicator will turn on for 5 seconds and then turn off (or slow flash if no node ID is stored). The unit can also be controlled by receiving command signals from the Z-Wave Controller.<\/p> <p>The unit is able to remember the status of the relay when power is cut off (such as power black-out). When power is supplied again, the unit will resume the last status of the relay (on or off)
