In the Z-Wave network communications, light switch can be connected to any Z-Wave gateway. When using radio waves, light switch can be used in conjunction with Z-Wave gateway. The frequency of radio waves used by gateway and switch is like this: different countries or areas, the radio frequency is different. Each light switch has a unique ID code. When we add or remove the switch from the alarm host, just place light switch in the Z-Wave network range of gateway. Then we can easily find the switch through the device ID code. In communication with gateway, light switch not only can send signals to Z-Wave gateway, but also can receive signals from it. When touch the button on light switch, it would send signals to Z-Wave gateway, then gateway can correctly display the switch on \/ off state; when light switch receives signals from gateway, the switch state would be remotely switched on\/off.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.038","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"eu1","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":82,"label":"Shenzhen Neo Electronics Co., Ltd","reference":600,"uuid":"shenzhen","url":"http:\/\/www.szneo.com\/"},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":930,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":8467,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8472,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8478,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2494,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":8468,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8475,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8471,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8474,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8476,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8473,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8470,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8469,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":8477,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Relay On\/Off Status Saved Enable","description":"Restore switch status on power restore.","units":"","overview":"<p>This parameter defines the on\/off status of relay needs saving or not.
