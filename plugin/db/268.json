Then press and release the push button on the side of EZMultiPli. Once EZMultiPli has been added to the Z-Wave network, the LED will stop blinking blue and instead will blink white each time it detects motion. EZMultiPli remains in this mode for 5 minutes. Once the 5 minutes has expired, EZMultiPli will enter normal operating mode and the LED will remain off. Pressing the push button will restart the 5 minute motion detector test mode. The primary controller should provide a Z-Wave NodeID which has been assigned to EZMultiPli. The NodeID is a unique identifier and is used by many home control applications to identify this particular EZMultiPli. Write down the NodeID and location for later entry into your home control application.<\/p>","label":"EZMultiPli","last_approval_time":"2019-08-15 08:40:31","listening":"1","overview":"<p>EZMultiPli\u2122 enables fully automated lighting that turns on the lights when you enter a room and turns them off shortly after you leave. Sophisticated lighting, Audio, Video and heating\/cooling are enabled with the EZMultiPli\u2122 threesensors-in-one Z-Wave\u00ae device.<\/p> <p>EZMultiPli is primarily intended as a motion sensor that will detect motion and send a command to up to 4 associated ZWave devices as well as the system controller. The other ZWave devices can directly control lights in a room or the motion indication can be sent to a computer for complex scene control of lighting, audio, video and heating\/cooling. When motion is not detected within a pre-set amount of time, EZMultiPli will send an \u201coff\u201d command to the Z-Wave nodes to turn the lights off.<\/p> <p>In addition to the motion sensor, EZMultiPli also senses the amount of light in the room as well as the current temperature. The color LED light within EZMultiPli is a convenient night light or can be used as an indicator light to let you know if the weather forecast is predicting rain, your garage doors are open or any other indicator supported by your home control application.<\/p> <p>EZMultiPli is wall powered and needs no wires or batteries. Simply plug EZMultiPli into the wall, join the Z-Wave network and you\u2019re ready to go.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.099","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"ezmultipli","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":21,"label":"Express Controls","reference":30,"uuid":"homeseer","url":""},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":110,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":735,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":728,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":731,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":5,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_temperature","config":"type=TEMPERATURE","label":"Sensor (temperature)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":282,"options":[]},{"name":"sensor_luminance","config":"type=LUMINANCE","label":"Sensor (luminance)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":283,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4112,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_COLOR","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"color_color","config":"colorMode=RGB","label":"Color","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1192,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":733,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":736,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_motion","config":"","label":"Motion Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":284,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":732,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":729,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":734,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":730,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"OnTime","description":"OnTime","units":"Minutes","overview":"<p>OnTime sets the number of minutes that the lights stay on when motion has not been detected.<\/p> <p>A value of 0 is a special mode where the lights are constantly sent a command to turn them on whenever motion is detected.
