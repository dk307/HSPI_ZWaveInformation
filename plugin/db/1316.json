The pushbuttons can send \u2019ON\u2019, \u2019OFF\u2019 and \u2019DIM\u2019 commands to the associated Z-Wave devices. These devices could be other light dimmers, blinds, sun-screens, etc.<\/p><p>The built-in light dimmer is per default attached to pushbutton 1. This attachment can be configured, thus it can be configured to not be controlled by any the four pushbuttons, so it can be independent of the local operation and thereby only be controllable from the Z-Wave network.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the pushbuttons can be configured to work together in pairs; thereby it can be possible to have one pushbutton to dim the light up, and another pushbutton to dim the light down.<\/p><p>MATRIX can also issue scene activation commands that can be used to activate scenes in the Z-Wave Controller.<\/p><p>The four RGB indicators, one for each pushbutton, can be used for different purposes, for example as orientation light, status light, different kind of indications, etc. The colour of the light and the control of it is fully controllable from the Z-Wave network.<\/p><p>MATRIX 55 also works as a repeater for the Z-Wave network and therefore expands the Z-Wave network
