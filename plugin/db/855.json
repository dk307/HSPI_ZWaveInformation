This motion detector is primarily designed for outdoor lighting control application.<\/p> <p>It features a PIR motion detector to detect movement in a protected area and a lux sensor for determining brightness of its surroundings. It comes with a built in timer to set the duration for light turn on. The lux level and the timer can be set through knobs on the device itself. If the PIR detects motion when lux level falls below a preset setting, the device will transmit a signal to turn on the outdoor lighting (or indirectly through gateway) and then later turns it off when its timer has elapsed.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.061","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"sp816","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>For waking up please triple click the tamper switch<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":8,"label":"Everspring","reference":96,"uuid":"everspring","url":""},"category":{"id":14,"label":"Motion Detector","category":"MotionDetector","description":"Motion sensors\/detectors"},"endpoints":[{"id":1257,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":11834,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11831,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11823,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"1","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3372,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":11836,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_TRANSPORT_SERVICE","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11824,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11825,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11822,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11839,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SUPERVISION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16201,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11828,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":4,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_motion","config":"","label":"Motion Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3373,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_power","config":"type=POWER_MANAGEMENT","label":"Alarm (power)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3374,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":11826,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11830,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11835,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11833,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11827,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11832,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11829,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11837,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":11838,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY_2","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Basic Set Level","description":"Basic Set Level","units":"","overview":"<p>When Basic Set Command is sent where contains a value, the receiver will take it for consideration;
