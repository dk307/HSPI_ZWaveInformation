All nodes whose Node ID<br \/>that have been set in Association group one will receive all unsolicited Alarm Report frames,<br \/>and Basic Report frames of 0x00 and 0xFF. Association group two is intended for any device<\/p> <p>that is controllable with a Basic Set of 0xFF such as lights, sirens, or chimes.<br \/>When a sensor such as a door or window sensor is opened\/faulted, the sensor will send a Basic<br \/>Report to nodes in Association group one and a Basic Set of 0xFF to Association group two.<br \/>When the door or window is closed the sensor will send a Basic Report of 0x00 to only group<br \/>one. The Configuration command class can configure the sensor to send Basic Sets of 0x00 to<br \/>nodes in group two (turning devices off).
