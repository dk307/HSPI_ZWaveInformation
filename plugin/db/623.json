It can switch all loads up to 3500 W. The device is IP 20 rated and can therefore only be used in dry environments. Switching is controlled wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally applying a button. A three color LED indicates the switching status.\u00a0Unplugging and replugging the module will reset the module to normal state.<\/p>","protocol_version":"2.051","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"duw064374","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":11,"label":"Reitz-Group.de","reference":100,"uuid":"reitz","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":838,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":7617,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7624,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7623,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2219,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":7622,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7621,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7619,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7618,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_HAIL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7620,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":7625,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":961,"file":"DUW-064374.pdf","label":"Schuko Plugin Switch IP20"},{"id":962,"file":"Duwi-Quickstart.pdf","label":"Duewi quickstart manual"},{"id":963,"file":"05437-Bed.pdf","label":"User manual (DE)"},{"id":1867,"file":"Download.jpg","label":"Product Image"}]}
