Revolutionary QuickFit design features a housing depth that is up to 20 percent smaller than the previous Z-Wave models. This reduced size coupled with the elimination of heat taps provides a better fit in older style boxes and multi-gang configurations. SimpleWire technology allows line and load to automatically be configured with auto-sensing line-load terminals. All of this is coupled with Z-Wave S2 and Smart Start allows for effortless installation while being safer than ever!<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.004","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"14296","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":10,"label":"Jasco Products","reference":99,"uuid":"ge","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":2023,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":19828,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19822,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19818,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_APPLICATION_STATUS","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19821,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5629,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":19816,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19826,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19829,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5630,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":19823,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19827,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19819,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19825,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19824,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19820,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19817,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":3,"label":"LED Mode","description":"LED Indication Configuration","units":"","overview":"<p>Adjust the LED status to default, invert, always OFF or always ON<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":2,"minimum":0,"maximum":3,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":8691,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Device is ON, LED is OFF;
