Place the magnet next to the sensor to represent a closed position (see Installation section to see where to position the magnet). If the LED flashes ONE TIME, it is successfully communicating on your Zwave network. If the LED on the sensor flashes slow and steady for 5 seconds, you need to repeat the inclusion process.<\/p> <p>Notes:<\/p> <p>If you need to repeat the inclusion process, repeat STEP ONE above, then for STEP TWO you will need to simply remove the cover of the sensor, remove the battery for 10 seconds, reinsert the battery, and replace the sensor cover. This will re-enter the sensor in inclusion mode.<\/p> <p>This sensor also supports Network Wide Inclusion such that the Sensor can be included into the Z-Wave network over the mesh network and not directly near the main controller.
