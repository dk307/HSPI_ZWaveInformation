FIBARO Flood Sensor is designed to be placed on the floor or mounted on a wall (in this case Flood Sensor probes should be extended using addition wire). The device has a built-in visual LED indicator and an acoustic alarm.<\/p> <p>In addition, the sensor is equipped with a tilt sensor reporting tilt or movement to the main controller e.g. when someone
