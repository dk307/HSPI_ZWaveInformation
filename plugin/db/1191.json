It is a universal z-wave slave and can be added to z-wave network or removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) or gateway.<\/p> <p>The wall controller is powered by a cell lithium battery. The wireless dimmer is compatible with single color z wave device SR-ZV9101FA-DIM and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m.<\/p> <p>It supports 3 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 2 groups association to devices, the groups association to devices support maximum 20 Z-wave devices per group. Compatible with existing frames from Berker, Gira, Jung and Merten, the z-wave secondary controller is easy to be mounted on the wall.<\/p> <p><strong>Key Features<\/strong><\/p> <ul><li>Z-wave
