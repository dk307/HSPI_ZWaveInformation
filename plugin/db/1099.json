The Z-Wave Plus wireless switch provides other programmable functions (scenes, events, association, child lockout, etc.) when used with Z-Wave compliant controllers. Each switch can be manually and remotely controlled by commands sent from an Z-Wave controller or other Z-Wave compatible controllers. The switch could be also controlled by wired 3-way switch. Eaton\u2019s Z-Wave switches are Z-Wave Plus certified. Eaton\u2019s Z-Wave accessory switches are Z-Wave Plus certified and comply with latest S2 security standards for advanced cyber
