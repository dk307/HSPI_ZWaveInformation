It continually measures the wind speed and can, for\u00a0example, trigger closing of the awning and blinds if it is too windy. It also measures the amount of rotation,\u00a0enabling calculation of the wind yield per day or per year. In addition, Z-Weather includes sensors for humidity,\u00a0temperature, pressure and dew point, essentially providing the core sensors of a weather station.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"<p>During normal operation, Z-Weather is limiting continuous measurement to wind speed and solar radiation, other\u00a0sensors are operating only on demand. This conservative energy management ensures continuous operation with\u00a0the limited energy harvested from the solar cell powering Z-Weather. The Z-Wave radio frequency transmitter is\u00a0turned off most of the time and is turned on if there is too much wind, at twilight time and on a continuous base,\u00a0depending on the energy budget. The wake up interval is between five minutes at noon in summer and five hours\u00a0in the second half of the night in winter. Z-Weather also wakes up on pushing the button.<\/p>","uuid":"pope005206","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Push the button once within 1.5 seconds.<\/p> <p>The LED blinks once indicating that Z-Weather is.
