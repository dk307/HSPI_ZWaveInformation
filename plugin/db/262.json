A tri-colour LED gives clear indication of the switch and network status. Switches on the front fascia provide local control, with tactile feedback.<\/p> <p>Fully integrated with our own products and running on the interoperable Z-wave standard this is an ideal candidate for applications where 2 channel low power remote switching is required. The tri-colour LED gives clear indication of switch states, while four tactile buttons, concealed behind a flap on the front fascia, provide local control.<\/p> \u00a0https:\/\/www.securemeters.com\/index.php\/products\/residential\/home-heating-hot-water-controls\/actuators\/ssr\/ \u00a0 \u00a0Application <ul><li> <p><strong>Boiler and hot water control\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p> <p>SSR302 is ideal for boiler control for heating and hot water when used together with a <strong><em>SRT321 <\/em><\/strong>room thermostat.
