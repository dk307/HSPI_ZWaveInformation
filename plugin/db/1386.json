Aging and faulty appliances, corroded water heaters, fixtures in bathrooms and laundry rooms can all cause water damage in the home, which is an expensive fix!  Our flood sensor alerts you when it gets wet. Just simply place on the floor near water using appliances and fixtures such as dishwashers, toilets, and washing machines. When paired with our automated water shut-off valve, it will signal the valve to automatically turn off the water supply, eliminating any further damage from occurring.  Sensor also monitors temperature to detect freezing conditions and even high heat in case of a fire.  Place the sensor directly on the floor or in a cabinet under or near water using appliances and fixtures.<br><\/p>","protocol_version":"4.039","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"fts05","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Check to make sure the sensor isn\u2019t already in a network.
