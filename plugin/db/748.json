In case of a detected incident the device will send an alarm message to a central controller and can in parallel directly control a group of devices, e.g. to shut off water supply. On the device it self the water event will be indicated using a red LED and a buzzer. This behavior can be configured. The device can be mounted on a wall for easy maintenance and the water is detected using a cabled detector head. The cable is 90 cm long. The device can also be used without the mounting base and will then flow on the water surface<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.038","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"pope700052","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>To wakeup the device please perform the following action: Double click the internal Button.
