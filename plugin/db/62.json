Equipped with a fingertip panel, many lighting scenarios can be covered and also reduce the energy consumption caused by the lamps. Some application examples are the time-controlled, gradual reduction of the light intensity, eg in the children's bedroom or hallways etc. <\/p> <p>The Smart Dimmer can be controlled via various remote controls, such as Bang &amp; Olufsen, Logitech 895 or the INNOVUS \"SmoothRemote\". The dimmers are also equipped with an integrated \"power meter\", which determines the energy consumption of the lamps. Connected to the House Control system, the power consumption of all devices connected to the dimmer can be measured.<\/p>","protocol_version":"0.000","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"00110001","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"1.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":13,"label":"INNOVUS","reference":119,"uuid":"innovus","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":531,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0 ","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":4562,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4563,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4564,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1313,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4565,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4566,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_TOGGLE_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4567,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_power","config":"type=POWER","label":"Sensor (Power in watts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1314,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4568,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_METER","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"meter_kwh","config":"type=E_KWh","label":"Electric meter (kWh)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1316,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_watts","config":"type=E_W","label":"Electric meter (watts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1317,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":4569,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4570,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4571,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4572,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4573,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":4574,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":0,"label":"Maximum dim level","description":"Maximum dim level","units":"","overview":"<p>Maximum Level, a limit on the maximum level the dimmer can reach.
