They changed the way we\u00a0watch TV. They changed we listen to music. They even changed the way we park our cars.\u00a0And then they stopped revolutionizing and instead evolved to become more and more\u00a0complex. They became bigger. They became weighed down with too many buttons, too many confusing things that you <em>could<\/em> do.<\/p> <p>The Aeotec Key Fob Remote Control takes the remote back to where it began. It\u2019s easy to\u00a0use. It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s there for when you need it and it\u2019s out of sight for when you\u00a0don\u2019t.
