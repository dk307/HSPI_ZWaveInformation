It may be connected to two-wire or three-wire configuration so it can operate with or without neutral lead. The dimmer can switch or dim connected light source either through Z-Wave devices or through the rotary knob directly. The smart dimmer is equipped with an algorithm of smart light source detection which makes configuration easier and ensures high compatibility of the device. It may be used as a switch with non-dimmable light sources (in 3- wire connection). The dimmer can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. The encryption mode that the dimmer supports is S2 Unauthenticated. When the dimmer is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller\/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration). The dimmer supports OTA and can update firmware wirelessly.<\/p>","protocol_version":"5.003","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zv2400tacsla","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":684,"label":"Sunricher","reference":816,"uuid":"sunricher","url":"www.sunricher.com"},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall
