It can switch all loads up to 3500 W. The plug switch is IP 44 rated and can, therefore, be used both in dry as well as humid environments in- and outdoor.<\/p> <p>Switching is controlled by the local button or wirelessly. The use of the local button and the behavior on wireless commands can be configured using configuration parameters. When detached from the control of local leads the button on the device can be used to trigger scenes in a central gateway. A single click and double click are distinguished.<\/p> <p>The device is also measuring the mains voltage supply reporting mains voltage and mains frequency. Additionally, the power consumption of the attached load is monitored as well.<\/p> <p>All metering values can be requested from the central controller and will be reported unsolicited if configured.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.001","routing":"1","usage":"<p>The device is able to switch electric loads up to 3500 W and can be switched wirelessly or using the local button. \u00a0The connected load is measured and reported. Trigger values can define unsolicited power reports. The device includes a virtual circuit breaker. The configuration values 26-28 define the behavior of this function. Depending on the configuration parameter 4 the local button with either control the local load or sends scene activation commands to the central gateway.<\/p>","uuid":"pope700397","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp &
