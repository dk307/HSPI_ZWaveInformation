Tap once on the backlit touch button to switch the device on and tap it again to turn it off, it\u2019s that simple. This 4 Touch Switch ensures an accurate response to every command that is sent through it.<br \/><br \/>The Hogar 4 Touch Switch can operate either independently or as a part of the Hogar smart home automation system, and even with any other certified Z-Wave home automation system. It is an extremely easy-to-use panel that can be installed in a standard BS 2 gang box. Its operating capabilities include a bi-stable mode, a relay mode or a touch pulse mode for scene control with a maximum load current of 3 amp. It communicates with the Hogar smart home automation system using the Z-Wave wireless communication
