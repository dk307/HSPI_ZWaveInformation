The dimmer can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary), so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the device. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product\u2019s firmware upgrade. The encryption modes that the LED dimmer supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the LED dimmer is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption.
