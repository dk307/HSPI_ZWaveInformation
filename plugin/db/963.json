Used for detecting combusting gas leakage and preventing danger caused by gas leakage it also can be used as Z-Wave repealer to extend wireless transmission distance. It adopts high stability semi-conductor gas sensor. Sensor alarms if gas density in air exceeds set alarm level. It is applicable for kitchen or possible gas leakage in in-door area.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.038","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"hmhs1cgz","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":45,"label":"Zipato","reference":305,"uuid":"zipato","url":"http:\/\/www.zipato.com\/"},"category":{"id":18,"label":"Sensor","category":"Sensor","description":"Device used to measure something"},"endpoints":[{"id":1452,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":13798,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13806,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13804,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13799,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13801,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":7,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_general","config":"","label":"Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3910,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":13802,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13800,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13805,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":13803,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Lifeline","max_nodes":1,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"<ul>\r\n<li>Lifeline between controller and the device.<\/li>\r\n<li>Supported command classes: Notification report, and Device Reset Locally notification.<\/li>\r\n<li>Association Group description: Association group 1: Lifeline association group<\/li>\r\n<li>Maximum supported node is 1.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Include command classes: Notification Report and Device Reset Locally notification.<\/p>","id":1838},{"group_id":2,"label":"Root Device group(Notification)","max_nodes":5,"controller":"0","description":"","overview":"<p style=\"left: 25.6931px; top: 302.899px; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.01371);\">Maximum supported nodes are 5.<br \/><br \/>1-Notification reports status of gas detected or no gas <br \/><br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Association group 1: Lifeline association group<br \/><br \/>2-When the sensor detects status change of gas detected and no gas detected, the device will be triggered.<\/p>","id":1839}],"documents":[{"id":1851,"file":"hm-hs1cg-z-USER-MANUAL.pdf","label":"Manual"},{"id":1852,"file":"hm-hs1cg-z.jpg","label":"Image"}]}
