This product is a Z-Wave\u00ae switched AC plug-in adapter. AC power can be remotely switched on or off manually with a button on the plug, remotely using Z-Wave manual control, or automatically with Z-Wave programming or triggered response.<\/p> <p>Using Z-Wave commands, you can query the plug-in to report the power consumption, either as direct wattage or the kilowatt hours (kWh). It also includes two USB ports, one capable of 1A of charging power and the other capable of 2.4A of charging power, so you can keep your mobile devices charged without using another AC power socket for a wall charger.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.024","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"wallsocket","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":86,"label":"Monoprice","reference":514,"uuid":"monoprice","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":1746,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":16899,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16911,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16900,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4769,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":16903,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16906,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4770,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":16897,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16896,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_METER","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"meter_voltage","config":"type=E_V","label":"Electric meter (volts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4765,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_current","config":"type=E_A","label":"Electric meter (amps)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4766,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_watts","config":"type=E_W","label":"Electric meter (watts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4767,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_kwh","config":"type=E_KWh","label":"Electric meter (kWh)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4768,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":16901,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16910,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16904,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16898,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16902,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16905,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16908,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16907,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":16909,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":20,"label":"Overload Protection","description":"If current exceeds 16.5A over 5 seconds, relay will turn off.","units":"","overview":"<p>If current exceeds 16.5A over 5 seconds, relay will turn off.<\/p> <p>0 -
