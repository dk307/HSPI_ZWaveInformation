The push-button coupler can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.<\/p><p>Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product\u2019s firmware upgrade.<\/p><p>This device supports the SmartStart inclusion. SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave network by scanning the Z-Wave QR Code present on the product with a controller providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required and the SmartStart product will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.<\/p><p>The push-button coupler has following functions:<\/p><ol ><li>Control of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF', Dim commands.<\/li><li>Activation of scenes in Gateway mode.<\/li><\/ol><p>The encryption modes that the push-button coupler supports are S0, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the coupler is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller\/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller\/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).<\/p><p><\/p>","protocol_version":"7.011","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"zv2833pac","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":684,"label":"Sunricher","reference":816,"uuid":"sunricher","url":"www.sunricher.com"},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":2351,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":24,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_WALL_CONTROLLER"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_BASIC_WALL_CONTROLLER"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":24119,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24133,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_TRANSPORT_SERVICE","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24120,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24121,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24122,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":6755,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":24123,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24135,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SUPERVISION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24124,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24125,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24126,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24127,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24128,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24129,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24130,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24131,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24132,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":24134,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY_2","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":2,"label":"External Switch Type","description":"External Switch Type","units":"","overview":"<p>0 -
