The on\/off switch replaces your current light switch, uses your existing wiring, and provides Z-Wave wireless and in-wall control of overhead lighting. The switch enables wireless control of on\/off functions of direct wire incandescent, LED, xenon, halogen and fluorescent lighting. Providing ultimate flexibility, the Jasco Z-Wave Smart Lighting Control On\/Off Switch allows you to operate the switch by itself or easily integrate the switch with two-way, three-way or four-way wiring configurations by adding the Jasco Add-On switch. Single pole wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on\/off from one location. Three-way wiring configuration turns the light on\/off from two separate locations. Four-way wiring configuration turns the light on\/off from three separate locations. The Jasco Add-On Switch is required for Three-way or Four-way installations. The lighting control includes a blue LED indicator light to easily locate the switch in a dark room. Take control of your home lighting with Jasco Z-Wave Smart Lighting Controls!<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"0","usage":"","uuid":"14318","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":10,"label":"Jasco Products","reference":99,"uuid":"ge","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":995,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":9119,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2661,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":9125,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9124,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":2662,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":9121,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9118,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CRC_16_ENCAP","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9130,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9127,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9120,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9131,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9129,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9122,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9123,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9128,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":9126,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":3,"label":"LED Light","description":"LED Light","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":1,"minimum":1,"maximum":2,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":6989,"options":[{"value":1,"label":"LED light on when Z-Wave turned on","id":9567},{"value":2,"label":"LED light always off","id":9568}]},{"param_id":4,"label":"Invert Switch","description":"Invert Switch","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":1,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"1","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":6990,"options":[{"value":1,"label":"Invert Switch","id":9569}]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Lifeline","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":2344},{"group_id":2,"label":"ontrolled with the local load.","max_nodes":5,"controller":"0","description":"Supports Basic Set","overview":"<p><span style=\"color: #6d6e71;
