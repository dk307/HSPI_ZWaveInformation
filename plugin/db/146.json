The four buttons can control other Z-Wave devices such as switches, dimmer and even door locks directly. Various options - configurable by Z-Wave configuration commands - define the actions and the commands used for this control. It is possible to use two sets of buttons (one of on\/open\/up and one for off\/closed\/down) or 4 single buttons to control 4 different groups of devices.<br \/><br \/>The controller also allows triggering scenes in a central controller. Again different modes can be configured to adapt to the various implementations of scenes in different central controllers in the market.<br \/><br \/>Control options also include special modes like 'all on\/off' or always controlling the Z-Wave device in proximity to the fob. The device supports secure communication when included with enhanced security option and when communicating to a device also supporting enhanced security option. Otherwise the device will automatically turn into normal communication. to maintain backward compatibility.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.099","routing":"0","usage":"","uuid":"kfob","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<ol><li>Enter management mode by pushing all four buttons together for one second - green led blinks slowly),<\/li> <li>Then hit button 2 .<\/li> <\/ol>","manufacturer":{"id":22,"label":"Z-Wave.Me","reference":277,"uuid":"zwaveme","url":""},"category":{"id":23,"label":"Remote Control","category":"RemoteControl","description":"Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":447,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":1,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_CONTROLLER"},"generic_class":{"id":1,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_GENERIC_CONTROLLER"},"specific_class":{"id":6,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_REMOTE_CONTROL_SIMPLE"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":3725,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3730,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":18500,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3727,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1093,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":3728,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3729,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3726,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3732,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3731,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3733,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":3724,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CMD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode","description":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode","units":"","overview":"<ul><li>In separate mode button 1 works with Group A, button 3 with Group C.
