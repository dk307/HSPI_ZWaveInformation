The module can be controlled either through Z-wave network or through the wall switch. The module is designed to be mounted inside a \u201cflush mounting box\u201d, hidden behind a traditional wall switch. Module measures power consumption of electrical device and supports connection of digital temperature sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network. Supported switches Module supports mono-stable switches (push button) and bi-stable switches.
