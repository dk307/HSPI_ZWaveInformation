It is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. Inclusion of this module on other manufacturer\u2019s wireless controller allows on\/off control of bulbs. Each module is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.<\/p>","protocol_version":"2.064","routing":"1","usage":"<p>To turn on or off the incandescent lamp controlled by the Module:<\/p><p>- Simply press and release the On\/Off knob. The red indicator LED will turn On\/Off and the incandescent lamp screwed into the Module will also turn On\/Off.<\/p><p>- With Z-Wave controller: simply press On or Off button on the controller.<\/p><p>- With Z-Wave routing slave: To do association between routing slave and Module through Z-Wave controller, the routing slave can control the On\/Off status of Module.<\/p>","uuid":"an145_2","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Thing is always awake<br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":66,"label":"ZyXEL","reference":309,"uuid":"zyxel","url":""},"category":{"id":12,"label":"Light Bulb","category":"LightBulb","description":"Devices that illuminate something, such as bulbs, etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":2186,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":3,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":22007,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":22006,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":22004,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"<p>Switches the bulb on or off<br><\/p>","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":6177,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":22003,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":22008,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":22002,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":22009,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":22005,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":3228,"file":"AN145_A501111195R02_201310041.pdf","label":"AN145 Manual"},{"id":3229,"file":"AN145_A4.pdf","label":"AN145 Specifications"},{"id":3232,"file":"an145.jpg","label":"Image"}]}
