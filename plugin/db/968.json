If this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network.

As a z-wave secondary controller,<br \/> it is a z wave light switch which can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers<br \/> or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to<br \/> primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group.<\/p> <p>It is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with dual color z wave device SR-ZV9102FA-CCT and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions.<\/p> <p>The controller is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.<\/p> <p><strong>Key
