Not only does the Smart Door Sensor efficiently eliminate household tasks as you go about your day, but remote monitoring allows you to feel secure once you\u2019ve left home. By simply opening or closing your door, the sensor uses Z-Wave technology to wirelessly trigger scenes throughout your home. From your mobile device, you\u2019re able to schedule lights to turn on as soon as you walk in and be notified of activity while you\u2019re away. Simple installation uses your door\u2019s existing hinge and pin, making setup a breeze. The sensor is discreetly designed to blend subtly into the frame of the door, adding the convenience of the Smart Door Sensor to your home without distracting from your household decor. Color-matching kits are also available, with options including white, dark brown and a paintable finish.<\/p> <h4>Features<\/h4> <ul><li>Works on all standard doors using your existing hinge<\/li> <li>Reversible for right and left door openings<\/li> <li>Adjusts to fit door trim<\/li> <li>Compatible with hinge pins up to 5\/16\" in diameter<\/li> <li>CR2 battery included (battery lasts up to 2 years)<\/li> <li>Color matching kits available<\/li> <\/ul>","protocol_version":"4.024","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"smartdoorsensor","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<ol><li>Press and hold the Z-wave Button for 6 seconds.
