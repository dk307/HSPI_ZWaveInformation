Thanks to its calibration technology the device cannot only be used to switch resistive devices but also works perfectly with many kind of reactive or resistive loads such as fluorescent lights or LEDs.<br \/>The device is placed in a wall box right behind the normal switch. The switch is not longer directly<br \/>connected to the load but acts as input device for the insert that is controlling the load. This device is<br \/>designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.041","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"pan06","version_max":"1.007","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":25,"label":"Philio Technology
