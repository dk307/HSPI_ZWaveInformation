It is the Z-Wave plus product, it support the security, OTA... all the newest features of the Z-Wave technology.\u00a0<br \/>Z-Wave is a wireless communication protocol designed for home automation, specifically to remotely control applications in residential and light commercial environments. The technology uses a low-power RF radio embedded or retrofitted into home electronics devices and systems, such as lighting, home access control, entertainment systems and household appliances.\u00a0<br \/>This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and\/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.<\/p> <p>The device adopts the Z-Wave 500 series chip. When your Z-Wave network system is all made by Z-Wave 500 series devices, the network system will have the advantages as below.<\/p> <ul><li>Concurrent multi-channel support reduces external interference<\/li> <li>Better RF range, about 10 meters improvement indoors.<\/li> <li>Supports 100 Kbps transmission speed<\/li> <\/ul><h1>POWER UP PROCEDURE<\/h1> <p>The device can not work normally in the first time. Please activate the battery through micro USB before the first use. After the device is activated by connecting to micro USB, the device will start charging and LED will light on with red color. If the battery is full charged, LED will light on with green color. When device is charging, it will send Wake Up Notification to controller minutely.<\/p> <h2>BATTERY POWER CHECK<\/h2> <p>When any keys around the central key is pressed, the device will check the battery power. If the power level is too low, the red LED will flash once after pressing. Please charge the device through micro USB immediately.<\/p> <h2>NWI<\/h2> <p>When it poweres up, the device will check if it is already added to the network. If it isn\u2019t, it will automatically start the NWI mode. The LED will flash in every second and continue for about 30 seconds, until timeout or successful inclusion by controller. You can hold down the central key and then press the top-right key 3 times within 1.5 seconds to abort the NWI mode.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"phpsr03","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>After the device is added to the network, it will wake-up once per day in default.
