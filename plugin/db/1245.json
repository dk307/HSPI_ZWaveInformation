The Sensor combines state-of-the-art optic design with advanced detection algorithms while covering up to 130 feet line of sight.<br \/>Low battery signalling allows for efficient power management and prolonged battery life. In addition, each Sensor is constantly monitored for tampering and reports to the receiver. <br \/>This device is typically used in conjunction with the DS-100 and complies with US and European standards.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"pir200","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Use paper clip, push button a few times.<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":3,"label":"Linear Corp","reference":335,"uuid":"linear","url":""},"category":{"id":14,"label":"Motion Detector","category":"MotionDetector","description":"Motion sensors\/detectors"},"endpoints":[{"id":1982,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":19390,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19392,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19391,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5517,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":19393,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19387,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_general","config":"","label":"Alarm","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5516,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":19386,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19389,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19394,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19388,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19395,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":5,"label":"Re-trigger duration","description":"Re-trigger duration","units":"minutes","overview":"<p>User can change value from 1 to 255 minutes to setup the re-trigger time when there is no movement detected in the period of time.<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":3,"minimum":1,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":8465,"options":[]},{"param_id":6,"label":"Motion Sensitivity","description":"Motion Sensitivity","units":"feels","overview":"<p>1 = sensitive<\/p> <p>7 = insensitive<\/p>","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":4,"minimum":1,"maximum":7,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":8466,"options":[{"value":1,"label":"Most sensitive","id":11347},{"value":2,"label":"little bit less than most sensitive","id":11348},{"value":3,"label":"mezzo sensitive","id":11349},{"value":4,"label":"medium sensitivity","id":11350},{"value":5,"label":"midi sensitivity","id":11351},{"value":6,"label":"fairly insensitive","id":11352},{"value":7,"label":"least sensitive","id":11353}]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Lifeline","max_nodes":1,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":2711}],"documents":[{"id":2873,"file":"evolve-super-garbage-motion-sensor.jpg","label":"picture"},{"id":2875,"file":"evolve-pir-200-installation.pdf","label":"Installation"},{"id":2876,"file":"linear-pir-200-evolve.pdf","label":"Manual"}]}
