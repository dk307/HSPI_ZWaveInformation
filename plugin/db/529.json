Z-Wave PlusTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave PlusTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-WaveTM enabled networks. Remote On\/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer\u2019s wireless Controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. Because PAN03 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.083","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"pan03","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":25,"label":"Philio Technology
