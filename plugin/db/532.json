The smoke detector\u2019s sensor head is certified with the Q quality label, conforms DIN EN 14604 and satisfies all contemporary legal requirements.<\/p> <p>The High-End 10-years smoke detector offers a large test button conveniently accessible even with a broomstick when mounted on the sealing. The smoke chamber is monitored electronically to avoid any malfunction and wrong alerts. The device will also report its end of life to make sure it is getting replaced on time.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, the device can be used as an independent indoor siren within the Z-Wave network, which can alarm in case of detected flood or burglary. Please consider that the additional siren function will influence battery lifetime!<\/p> <p>The smoke sensor and the Z-Wave controller communicate via a secure protocol to prevent manipulation.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"009402","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"1.014","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":20,"label":"Smoke Detector","category":"SmokeDetector","description":"Smoke detectors"},"endpoints":[{"id":692,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":6078,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6081,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6075,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1732,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":6080,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1736,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":6082,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6085,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6076,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6077,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6079,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":5,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_system","config":"type=SYSTEM","label":"Alarm (system)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1733,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_smoke","config":"type=SMOKE","label":"Alarm (smoke)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1734,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_burglar","config":"type=BURGLAR","label":"Alarm (burglar)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1735,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":6087,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6073,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6084,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6083,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6074,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6086,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Siren alarm sequence interval","description":"Siren alarm sequence interval","units":"","overview":"<p>The additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm.
