Retrofit existing mechanical timers or install with new construction. Integrates with home automation software that utilizes Z-Wave wireless technology.<\/p> <p>The unit itself is the PE653, which is a control box that directly controls the pump(s) and heater as well as connects to a temperature probe.<\/p> <p>The unit also typically comes with a hand held wireless remote (the PE953). In standard mode, this controller is a primary controller that only has the PE653 in a local Z-Wave network. To use this controller in another z-wave network, the PE653 is included in that network and then the PE953 is set as a secondary controller.<\/p> <p>This unit has support for 1 and 2 speed pumps as
