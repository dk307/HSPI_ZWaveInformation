When the detector is cooperated with security appliances, the detector is acting as a security device by detecting changes in infra-red radiation levels.<\/p> <p>If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted to cause full alarm condition in order to frighten intruders away.<\/p> <p>Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave controller, the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in infra-red radiation levels and percentage of lux levels. Once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected lightings for better illumination.<\/p> <p>This product supports the S2 security protocol that uses encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security-enabled Z-Wave Plus products.
