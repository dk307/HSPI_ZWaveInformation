Z-WaveTM enabled devices<br \/>displaying the Z-WaveTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the<br \/>manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-WaveTM<br \/>enabled networks. Inclusion of this detector on other manufacturer\u2019s Wireless<br \/>Controller menu allows remote operation of connected modules when the<br \/>detector is triggered.<br \/>The detector is designed to sense smoke that comes into the detector chamber.<br \/>It does not sense gas, heat, or flame. The working principle is when the smoke<br \/>detector detects a certain density of smoke, the horn of smoke detector will<br \/>sound and in the meantime, the detector will emit the signals to the associated<br \/>devices for further execution. It can provide precious time for you and your<br \/>family to escape before a fire spreads.<\/p>","protocol_version":"2.064","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"sf812","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":8,"label":"Everspring","reference":96,"uuid":"everspring","url":""},"category":{"id":20,"label":"Smoke Detector","category":"SmokeDetector","description":"Smoke detectors"},"endpoints":[{"id":50,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":161,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_ALARM"},"specific_class":{"id":7,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SMOKE_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":368,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":374,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":370,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_tamper","config":"type=SMOKE","label":"Alarm (tamper)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":116,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_battery","config":"type=POWER_MANAGEMENT","label":"Alarm (Low battery)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1490,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":371,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":369,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":372,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":373,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":367,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_ALARM","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_smoke","config":"type=SMOKE","label":"Alarm (smoke)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":115,"options":[]}]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Alarm notifications","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":52}],"documents":[{"id":29,"file":"Everspring-Smokedetector-SF-812.pdf","label":"Everspring Smoke Detector SF812 Manual"},{"id":606,"file":"SF812.jpg","label":"SF812"}]}
