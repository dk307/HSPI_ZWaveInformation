It can be configured to control up to Four separate Light Zones or Central Scenes. Each Light Zone can consist of both Dimmers and Switches. The device can be combined with a Back Unit, which provide local Switch or Dimmer functionality.\u00a0<br \/>Room and Floor temperature sensors can also be connected to the device, which enables the device to function as a head-less Thermostat. The Thermostat is fully controllable from a Z-Wave Controller, and can control both a Local and Remote heating relay.<\/p> <p>The Multifunction Switch is capable of controlling local loads via a modular Back Unit. The back unit can be mounted and connected to mains electricity inside a Electrical Wall box. Two types of Relay and Dimmer Back Units are currently available.
