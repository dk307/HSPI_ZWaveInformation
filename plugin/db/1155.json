Revolutionary QuickFit design features a housing depth that is up to 20 percent smaller than the previous Z-Wave models. This reduced size coupled with the elimination of heat taps provides a better fit in older style boxes and multi-gang configurations. SimpleWire technology allows line and load to automatically be configured with auto-sensing line-load terminals. All of this is coupled with Z-Wave S2 and Smart Start allows for effortless installation while being safer than ever!<\/p>","protocol_version":"0.000","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"zw4008","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":10,"label":"Jasco Products","reference":99,"uuid":"ge","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":1804,"number":0,"label":"","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":17595,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17597,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17586,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_APPLICATION_STATUS","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17585,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4943,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":17596,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17576,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17592,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17589,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17593,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":6603,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":17588,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17582,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":4,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17590,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17591,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17594,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":4,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17587,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17577,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17670,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":3,"label":"LED Indication Configuration","description":"Configure LED indication to default, invert, always off or always on","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":3,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":7704,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"LED ON when device is OFF","id":10431},{"value":1,"label":"LED ON when device is ON","id":10432},{"value":2,"label":"LED always OFF","id":10433},{"value":3,"label":"LED Always ON","id":10434}]},{"param_id":19,"label":"Alternate Exclusion","description":"Default -
