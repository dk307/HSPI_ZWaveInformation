Z-Wave nodes of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.As part of a Z-Wave network, the TZ65D will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.040","routing":"1","usage":"<p>BASIC OPERATION\u00a0(Local control)<br \/> The left switch on the TZ65D allows the user to:<\/p> <ul><li>Turn ON or OFF the attached load.<\/li> <li>Include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave system.<\/li> <li>Control other Z-Wave enabled devices.(one\u00a0\u201cassociated\u201d\u00a0group of 5 each-Groups 1)<\/li> <\/ul><p>The right switch on the TZ65D allows the user to:<\/p> <ul><li>Control other Z-WAVE enable devices (two\u00a0\u201cassociated\u201d\u00a0group of 5 each-Groups 1)<\/li> <\/ul><p>Also, when a controller prompts you to\u00a0\u201cSend Node ID\u201d\u00a0or to\u00a0\u201cPress Button on\u00a0Unit\u201d, quickly tap the switch ON or OFF once to satisfy those instructions.<\/p> <ul><li>Tapping top of left switch turns the load attached ON.<\/li> <li>Tapping bottom of left switch turns the load attached OFF<\/li> <li>Pressing and holding the left switch will allow dimming and brightening the\u00a0attached load or the other Z-Wave dimmers if associated.

It is best to turn off the power at the circuit breaker to service the load.<br \/>Upon restoration of power after a power loss, the TZ65D returns to previous\u00a0known state. LED IndicationThe LED on the TZ65D will turn on when the load attached is off, to act as a night light. However, the LED can be user configured to turn on when the load attached is on. The TZ65D will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of the 4 groups. This can\u00a0be changed if desired.
