Each switch can freely control other Z-Wave devices, allowing you to control up to 4 external light zones. The devices in each light zone can be controlled with the commands 'ON', 'OFF' and 'DIM'.<\/p><p>The two relays can each be configured to belong to one of these 4 light zones, or they can be completely independent of the local operation (and thus only controlled via Z-Wave communication).<\/p><p>Furthermore, each switch can be used for operation individually or the control can be configured so that the contacts can work together in pairs, e.g. so that one switch is used to turn up the light and the other can turn down.<\/p><p>MATRIX allows the activation of scenes in the Z-Wave Controller (Command Class Central Scene).<\/p><p>MATRIX has a tangent front with four fields, where the field is backlit using 3-color LEDs, so-called RGB LEDs. The LEDs can combine the 3 basic colors and thereby form countless other colors. The light can be used as various function indications, such as orientation lights, control lights, etc. see the section on LEDs.<\/p><p>MATRIX is designed to fit in all FUGA compatible cans and substrates. The unit also fits in all FUGA compatible frame types and sizes.<\/p><p>In addition, MATRIX also acts as a Z-Wave repeater and will thereby extend the reach of the Z-Wave network.
