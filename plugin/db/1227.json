Although it is controlling other devices, the Wall Controller cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. The device can be used in different modes that are selected by configuration parameters:<\/p> <ol><li>Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF' and Dim commands.<\/li> <li>Activation of predefined scenes in Gateways or other Z-Wave devices.<\/li> <\/ol><p>This device support <strong>secure communication<\/strong> when included by a controller that also supports securecommunication. The device will then send all commands as secure commands unless the receiving device cannot accept them. Then the command is send the normal way automatically.<\/p> <p><strong>Batteries<\/strong><br \/><br \/>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of with household waste!<br \/><br \/>Battery Type:\u00a0 <strong>1 x CR2032<\/strong><\/p> <p><strong>Installation Guidelines<\/strong><br \/><br \/>On factory default state pushing any button for one seconds starts inclusion (red\/green LED blinking fast). Thisbehavior can be used to test the factory default or exclusion state.<br \/><br \/>The device can be mounted on every dry and flat surface using either screws or double side adhesive. First the mounting base is fixed on the wall. Next step the switch frame is placed on the 2 frame and the electronic insert is used to fix the frame to the mounting base as shown on the image. Finally the switching paddle(s) are mounted on the electronic base.<br \/><br \/>For battery change, the switching paddle(s) need to be removed. The CR battery can be replaced by pushingthe little nipple above the battery. The old battery will slide out and the new battery is inserted until the nipple will hold it again.<br \/><br \/>The device can be operated in two different modes:<br \/><br \/><strong>Operation Mode:<\/strong><\/p> <p>This is the mode where the device is controlling other Z-Wave devices or isactivating scenes.<br \/><br \/><strong>Management Mode:<\/strong><\/p> <p>The device is turned into the management mode by pushing all four buttons for 5 sec. A blinking green LED indicates the management mode. In the management mode the buttons of the device have different functions. If no further action is performed, the device will turn back tothe normal mode after 10 sec. Any management action terminates the management mode as well.<br \/><br \/>In management mode the following actions can be performed:<\/p> <p><strong>Button 1:<\/strong><\/p> <p>Re-Inclusion\/Exclusion: Every re-inclusion or exclusion attempt is confirmed by hittingthis button. Any button press stops the mode as well.<\/p> <p><strong>Button 2:<\/strong><\/p> <p>Send Node Information Frame and Wake up Notification. (see explanation below)<\/p> <p><strong>Button 3:<\/strong><\/p> <p>Factory Default Reset. After clicking on button 3 keep button 4 pushed for &gt;4 seconds<\/p> <p><strong>Button 4:<\/strong><\/p> <p>Enter into Association mode to assign target devices to one of the four association. Referto the manuals section about association for more information how to set and unset association groups.<\/p> <p><strong>Factory Reset<\/strong><br \/><br \/>The device can be set back to factory defaults without performing an exclusion process. Please executes the following steps: (1) Turn the device into Management Mode, (2) click on Button 3, (3) keep button 4 pushed for 4 seconds.<\/p> <p><strong>Child Protection<\/strong><br \/><br \/>The device can be turn into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled. The device can be turned into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled. The child protection mode MUST be turned on wirelessly. However, in protected by sequence mode it is possible to unlock the device for local operation by pressing any button for 5 seconds. The unlock state will last for 5 seconds.<\/p> <p><strong>LED Control<\/strong><br \/><br \/>1. Confirmation - green 2 sec<br \/>2. Failure - red 2 sec<br \/>3.

Single click turns devices in the control group on, double click turns themoff. Click and hold can be used for dimming.<br \/><br \/><strong>2 Groups are controlled with two buttons (parameter 1\/2 = 1)<\/strong> The buttons 1 and 3 control the control group A (button on turns on, buttons turns off), the buttons 2 and 4 control the control group B (button on turns on, buttons turns off). In case dimmers are controlled, holding down the larger button will dim up, holding downthe smaller button will dim down the load. Releasing the button will stop the dimming function.<br \/><br \/><strong>4 Groups are controlled with two buttons and double click (parameter 1\/2 = 2) <\/strong>This mode enhances the previous mode and allows to control two further control groups C and D using double clicks.<br \/><br \/>Operating modes:<br \/><br \/>The devices supports 8 different operating modes - this means the kind of command sent out when pushing abutton. Operating modes either directly control other devices or they issue various scene activation commands to a central controller. Operating modes for direct device control are:<br \/><br \/><strong>Direct Control of associated devices with On\/Off\/Dim commands (parameter 11...14 = 1)<\/strong>. Devices are controlled using Basic Set On\/Off commands and SwitchMultilevel Dim Start\/Stop. This mode implements communication pattern 7.<br \/><br \/><strong>Direct Control of associated devices with only On\/Off commands (parameter 11...14 = 2)<\/strong>. Devices are controlled using only Basic Set On\/Off commands. On dimming Up event On is sent, on dimming Down Off is sent. This mode also implements communication pattern 7.<br \/><br \/><strong>Switch All commands (parameter 11...14 = 3)<\/strong> In this mode a all neighbouring devices will receive SwitchAll Set On\/Off command and interpret it according to their membership in SwitchAll groups.This mode implements communication pattern 7.<br \/><br \/><strong>Door Lock Control (parameter 11...14 = 7)<\/strong> This modes allows direct control (open\/close) of electronic door locks using secure communication. The mode implements communication pattern 7.<br \/><br \/>Operating modes for scene activation are:<br \/><br \/><strong>Direct Activation of preconfigured scenes (parameter 11...14 = 5)<\/strong> Associated devices in an association group are controlled by individual commands defines by Z-Wave command class \u2018Scene Controller Configuration\u2019. This mode enhances mode Direct Control of associated devices with On\/Off\/Dim commands and implements communication patterns 6 and 7. Please turn the button mode to 'seperate' to allow different scene id on every button.<br \/><br \/><strong>Scene Activation in IP Gateway (parameter 11...14 = 4)<\/strong> If configured correctly the buttons can trigger a scene in a gateway. The scene number triggered is a combination of the group number and the action performed on the button and has always two digits. The group number defines the upper digit of the scene number, the action the lower digit. The following actions are possible:1 = On<br \/>2 = Off<br \/>3 = Dim Up Start<br \/>4 = Dim Down Start<br \/>5 = Dim Up Stop<br \/>6 = Dim Down Stop<br \/><br \/>Example: Clicking\/double clicking the button will issue scene triggers, scene 11 (button 1 click, event on), scene 12 (button double click 1, event off, single button control is used in this example)<br \/><br \/><strong>Activation of Central Scenes (parameter 11...14 = 8, Default)<\/strong> Z-Wave Plus introduces a new process for scene activation - the central scene control. Pushing a button and releasing a button sends a certain command to the central controller using the lifeline association group. This allows to react both on button push and button release. This mode implements communication patterns 6 but requires a central gateway supporting Z-Wav Plus.<\/p>","uuid":"schwzhs03","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time. Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller C is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store commands that can not be received during deep sleep state. Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and\/or the battery life time is significantly decreased.<br \/><br \/>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification. The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal battery life time and the desired responses of the device.<br \/><br \/>The device will stay awake right after inclusion for 10 seconds allowing the controller to perform certa inconfiguration actions. It is possible to manually wake up the device by pushing button 2 in management mode.<br \/><br \/>The minimum allowed wakeup time is 240s but it is strongly recommended to define a much longer interval since the only purpose of a wakeup should be the reporting of the battery status or an update of the child protection settings. Defining Node ID of 0 as a destination of the Wakeup Notification will disable the periodical wakeup function entirely.<br \/><br \/>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup.<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":706,"label":"Pixela Corporation","reference":631,"uuid":"pixela","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":1949,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":24,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_WALL_CONTROLLER"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_BASIC_WALL_CONTROLLER"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":19072,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19057,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19059,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5387,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":19058,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19047,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_CONTROLLER_CONF","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19052,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":5388,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":19050,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19051,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19043,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19044,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19045,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19046,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":19049,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CMD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode","description":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode","units":"","overview":"<p>In separate mode button 1 works with group A, button 3 with groups C.
