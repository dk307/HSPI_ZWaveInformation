hardware revision update to EcoLink's prior PIR sensor. \u00a0It provides the same general capabilities as the prior detector--motion detection, battery state messages, and \"burgler\" alarm for the case being opened. \u00a0On motion detection a green LED will flash and the notification will be sent to Group 1.<\/p> <p><strong>Association Groups:<\/strong><\/p> <p>The device has two association groups of up to 5 nodes each.<\/p> <p><strong>Configuration Parameters:<\/strong><\/p> <p>The device has two configuration parameters.\u00a0Parameter 1 configures the sensor to send or not send Basic Set commands of 0x00 to nodes in Association group 2 turning the devices off when the sensor is in a restored state (i.e. motion not detected). \u00a0By default the sensor does NOT send Basic Set commands of 0x00. \u00a0Paremter 2 configures the sensor to either send or not to send Sensor Binary Report commands to Association Group 1 when the sensor is faulted and restored. \u00a0If the controller is fully compatible with the Notification Command Class thereby making the Sensor Binary Reports redundant, the controller \u00a0can disable the Sensor Binary Report Commands
