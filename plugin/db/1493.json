Its type of emborning is by cut and can be installed both vertically and horizontally. It should be noted that the voltage capacity of this front kit for 1 element with 1 Simon iO switch will be 250V. This product of the Simon 100 series features activation using a push-button. The interval for the temperature of its proper operation will be from 5\u00ba C to 40\u00ba C and its storage temperature range is from -25\u00ba C to 50\u00b0 C. For proper maintenance it is suggested to dampen a soft cloth slightly in soapy water, thus avoiding the use of abrasive cleaners that contain chlorine and may compromise the surface of the cloth.<br><\/p>","protocol_version":"4.024","routing":"1","usage":"<p><br><\/p>","uuid":"10001020-230","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p><br><\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":691,"label":"SimonTech
