A Z-Wave hub can use local weather conditions and connected rain and moisture sensors to optimizes the use of the scheduled watering cycles. As a connected device, sprinklers can be turned on or off from anywhere there is internet connectivity.\u00a0<br \/>Integrated diagnostics and flow sensor support help determine breaks or improper operation of the irrigation system.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.024","routing":"1","usage":"<p>The WI15VZ-1 is designed to run the irrigation system based on your preprogrammed schedule. Utilizing your Z-Wave Hub, you can create this schedule. It will be saved in the WI15VZ-1 and run automatically unless an Interrupt is sent or received.<\/p> <p>Each valve can run independently and be triggered as part of a scene. See the Hub instructions on how to confi gure your system to operate in this manner.<\/p> <p>To trigger a specifi c valve that is connected to the WI15VZ-1, use the control application associated to your Z-Wave Hub.<\/p> <p>Weather\/Optional Water Sensor Interrupt<\/p> <p>The WI15VZ-1 can take instructions from your Hub to not run the predetermined irrigation schedule. In the event that your local weather causes the WI15VZ-1 to not run the predetermined irrigation schedule, the LED will blink red\/green for as long as the valves are supposed to be running. Once the valves are scheduled to be turned off, it will stop blinking.<\/p> <p>All Stop<\/p> <p>In the event that you wish to stop the running of the Irrigation Controller, press the button on the front of the WI15VZ-1. The Active LED will turn off. The Status LED will blink Orange. It will continue to blink Orange until the user presses the button again, or the Hub tells it to go back to normal mode.<\/p> <p>Valve Fault Detection<\/p> <p>The WI15VZ-1 can detect if a valve is disconnected or has damaged or shorted control wires. In the event that a Fault is detected, the Status LED will blink Red as long as the valve is scheduled to be running. Once the valve is scheduled to be off, or turned off by the Hub, it will stop blinking Red.<\/p> <p>Power Fault Detection<\/p> <p>The WI15VZ-1 can determine if there is a problem with the power provided by the power supply. In the event that a Fault is detected, the Status LED will toggle Red\/Orange until the problem is corrected.\u00a0
