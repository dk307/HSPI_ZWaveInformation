The four buttons can control other Z-Wave devices such as switches, dimmer and even door locks directly. Various options \u2013 configurable by Z-Wave configuration commands \u2013 define the actions and the commands used for this control. It is possible to use two sets of buttons (one for on\/open\/up and one for off\/closed\/down) or four single buttons to control four different groups of devices.<\/p> <p>The controller also allows triggering scenes in a central controller. Again different modes can be configured to adapt to the various implementations of scenes in different central controllers in the market. Control options also include special modes like \u201eall on\/off\u201c or always controlling the Z-Wave device in proximity to the controller.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"0","usage":"","uuid":"009303","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>see attached file \"Popp 009303 Battery Wall Controller Manual\" (section Reference Documents)<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":270,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":1,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_CONTROLLER"},"generic_class":{"id":24,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_WALL_CONTROLLER"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_BASIC_WALL_CONTROLLER"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":2037,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2031,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":6758,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":1936,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":6757,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2042,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_CONTROLLER_CONF","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2044,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2038,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2049,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":631,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2033,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2035,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2036,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2032,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2030,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2040,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2034,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2039,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2043,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2041,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CMD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode","description":"Button 1 and 3 pair mode.","units":"","overview":"<p>In separate mode button 1 works with Group A, button 3 with Group C.
