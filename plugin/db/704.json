Supporting Energy Monitoring the PS15EMZ5-1 will provide both a visual indication of the amount of energy the connected device is using, and also transmit this information to the Z-Wave hub for tracking purposes. The long life LEDs will also act as a night light that your hub can turn off during daylight hours. The integrated button can be used to turn the connected device on \/ off, but it can also be temporarily disabled to eliminate the inadvertent operation of the device. With Over The Air upgrading supported, this device can be seamlessly updated to the most recent firmware and features.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.034","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"ps15emz51","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":3,"label":"Linear
