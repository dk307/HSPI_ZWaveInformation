All Z-Wave devices must be \"Included\" on the Controller (Hub) before it can be controlled from a smart device. The Hub should be brought physically closer to the device just for the \"Inclusion\" process (recommended within 10ft). When finished, the Hub and device can be moved back to final installation location. Download the App or log onto the website associated with the Hub you are using and follow their Inclusion\/ Exclusion instructions as each Hub's programming and features are different.<\/p> <ul><li>During the Inclusion\/ Exclusion process, the Program Button on the relay or the ON\/OFF toggle on the switch can be used for including\/ excluding the device.<\/li> <li>When using the ON\/OFF toggle, the toggle must be toggled ON and OFF 3 times.<\/li> <li>It is best to perform an Exclusion of the device prior to performing an Inclusion.<\/li> <\/ul><p>Step 1.
