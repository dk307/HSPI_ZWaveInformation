Used for detecting combusting gas leakage and preventing danger caused by gas leakage it also can be used as Z-Wave repeater to extend wireless transmission distance. It adopts high stability semiconductor gas sensor.<\/p> <p>Sensor alarms if gas density in air exceeds set alarm level. It is applicable for kitchen or possible gas leakage in in-door area.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.038","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"dx1cgz","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":673,"label":"Heiman Technology Co.
