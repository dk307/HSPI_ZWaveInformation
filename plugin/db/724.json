It can report immediate wattage consumption or kWh energy usage over a period of time. In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the unit\u2019s operating status.<\/p> <p>It can connect to 2 external manual switches to control the load ON\/OFF independently. Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Dual Nano Switch.<\/p> <p>The Dual Nano Switch is also a security Z-Wave device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.<\/p> <p><strong>Reset your Dual Nano Switch.<\/strong><\/p> <p>If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Dual Nano Switch\u2019s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your Dual Nano Switch will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then remain the colourful gradient status as a
