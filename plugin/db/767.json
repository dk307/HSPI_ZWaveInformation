It receives Z-Wave transmissions\u00a0and converts them to motor control commands for Somfy\u2019s Sonesse 50 ILT2 (AC) motor\u00a0and Sonesse 30 RS485 (DC) motor. The interface also receives feedback information from\u00a0these motors and distributes it to the Z-Wave network.<\/p>","protocol_version":"2.078","routing":"1","usage":"<p>The ZDMI interface can be operated by 3rd party automation, handheld and PC based controllers, or by manually by pressing the SETUP button.
