This sensor is a Z-Wave\u2122 enabled device (interoperable, two-way RF mesh networking technology) and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave\u2122 enabled network and it\u2019s security framework. Every mains powered Z-Wave\u2122 enabled device acts as a signal repeater and multiple devices result in more possible transmission routes which helps eliminate \u201cRF dead-sports\u201d.<\/p> <p>Z-Wave\u2122 enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave\u2122 logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-Wave\u2122 enabled networks. This product will sound a loud siren and flash a strobe light when an alarm message or alert is received on any Z-Wave\u2122 enabled network. When the ZM 1602 main power has dropped out, the backup batteries will automatically install. When the device is secure included into Z-Wave network, above communication will be encrypted<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zm1602","version_max":"14.000","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":17,"label":"Vision Security","reference":265,"uuid":"vision","url":"http:\/\/www.visionsecurity.com.tw\/"},"category":{"id":19,"label":"Siren","category":"Siren","description":"Siren used by Alarm systems"},"endpoints":[{"id":276,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":null,"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":2105,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2106,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2110,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":643,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2107,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2109,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2108,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":0,"label":"Siren Strobe Mode","description":"Defines the reaction of the siren","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"","write_only":"","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":577,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Strobe and Siren","id":677},{"value":1,"label":"Siren","id":678},{"value":2,"label":"Strobe","id":679}]},{"param_id":1,"label":"Alarm auto stop","description":"Defines the auto time out of the alarm indication","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"","write_only":"","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":578,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"30 seconds","id":680},{"value":1,"label":"60 seconds","id":681},{"value":2,"label":"120 seconds","id":682},{"value":3,"label":"Continuous","id":683}]}],"associations":[],"documents":[{"id":192,"file":"vision-zm1602-manual-us.pdf","label":"User Manual"},{"id":280,"file":"ZM-1602-5-Siren-20150507.pdf","label":"User Manual (with configuration)"},{"id":754,"file":"VSN-ZM1602.jpg","label":"Product Image"}]}
