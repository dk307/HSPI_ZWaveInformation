The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of light like incandescent, fluorescent and LED light.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This in-wall switch module is able to detect Instant power wattage (5~1500W) and overload wattage (1600~1700W) of connected light or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Module will be disabled and its On\/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly. However, disconnect and re-connect the Module will reset its overload condition to normal
