The built-in metering unit is of high quality: it calculates the true-power and also works for small loads from 1W upwards. This feature is important to have a correct measurement value also for electronic loads like led lamps.<\/p> <p>The PSC152ZW\u00a0has a built-in safety features that will switch-off the output in case of too high temperature or overload.\u00a0<br \/>Additionally the PSC152\u00a0has a feature to switch the load on at zero voltage and switch the load off at zero current. This leads to a very high number of possible switching cycles also for difficult loads like led-lamps or motors, e.g. pumps.\u00a0<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Factory
