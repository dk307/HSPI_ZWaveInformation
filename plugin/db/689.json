Based on Z-Wave Plus\u2122 technology, it offers longer battery life, faster operation, better RF coverage, and easier installation while keeping compatibility with classic Z-Wave\u2122 products. You can set an alarm via the mydlink\u2122 Home app so when you\u2019re away, the DCH-Z310 will be enabled and ready to send signals to a hub such as the mydlink\u2122 Home Connected Home Hub. When the alarm is triggered, it will generate an 85 dB (max) audio alarm while pushing instant notifications to your mobile device, so you can stay informed from wherever you are.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.005","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"dchz310","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>After the device is added to the network, it will wake-up once per day in default.
