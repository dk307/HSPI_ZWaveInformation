The SwiidPlug\u2122 can be operated manually by pressing on its FUNCTION button which then acts as an on\/off toggle switch and can be operated remotely and wirelessly by Z -Wave\u00ae. The SwiidPlug\u2122 can also handle associations with other devices, both ways to and from it. Thus, your SwiidPlug\u2122 can respond directly to a signal from another Z-Wave\u00ae device in your network, such as the triggering of a presence detector. As soon as it has been plugged into a mains socket, the SwiidPlug\u2122 can be included into a Z-Wave\u00ae network so as to interoperate with controllers and other Z-Wave\u00ae devices.\u00a0<\/p> <p>http:\/\/www.swiid.com\/medias\/documents\/ZAP-User-s-manual-vBAT-30.11.2014.pdf<\/p> <p>http:\/\/www.swiid.com\/medias\/documents\/advanced-swiidplug.pdf<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.095","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"swzap1","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":44,"label":"CBCC Domotique SAS","reference":358,"uuid":"cbcc","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":1541,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":14503,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14507,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14502,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"1","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4113,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":14509,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14500,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14498,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14506,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14637,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14508,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14501,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14504,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14510,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14499,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":14505,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Switch All","description":"Switch All","units":"","overview":"","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":255,"minimum":0,"maximum":255,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":5956,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled (Default)","id":8386},{"value":255,"label":"Enabled","id":8387}]}],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Group 1","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1956},{"group_id":2,"label":"Group 2","max_nodes":5,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":1957}],"documents":[{"id":1969,"file":"ZAP-User-s-manual-vBAT-30-11-2014.pdf","label":"ZAP User Manual"},{"id":1970,"file":"Swiid-Plug-Led-Bleue.jpg","label":"Swiid_Plug_Led_Bleue"},{"id":1971,"file":"Advanced-swiidplug.pdf","label":"Advanced swiidplug"}]}
