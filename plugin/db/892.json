Additionally a bell key allows emulating a doorbell by operating e.g. a door bell or a light or both. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The device can operate in two different modes. The mode is chosen the way the device is included into a Z-Wave network:<\/p> <ol><li><strong>Stand Alone Mode.<\/strong> In this case the keypad acts as the primary network controller and will include other devices such as e.g. a strike lock control or a door bell. No other central controller is needed. The management of user codes is done using the keypad itself.<\/li> <li><strong>Network Mode.<\/strong> The keypad is included as additional device into an exiting network. In Z-Wave terms it will then act as inclusion (secondary) controller. It will send commands to a central controller and is managed by this controller. In this mode the device can still directly control door locks but it can also be used to trigger scenes in a central controller.\u00a0<\/li> <\/ol><p>The device is protected by a tamper switch sending out an alarm message when the enclosure is opened.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.054","routing":"0","usage":"<p>The keypad allows typing in up to 20 different key codes and pressing certain dedicated buttons. Key codes are numbered 1...20 must have minimum 4 and maximum 10 digits as number between 0 und 9. All key codes are equal except key code #20 that will also activate the management mode. Beside the 10 numerical keys the devices offers a ENTER key (*), an ESCAPE key (#) and a Bell key. Every key entry needs to be confirmed by \"*\". Sequences can be aborted using the \"#\"\u00a0key.<br \/>The bell key will immediately cause ringing a bell if there is a bell devices included in association group 3. \u00a0They entry of the key code should be confirmed by \"*\". If no \"*\" is entered the entry will time out and use the key entered so far. This means its possible not to confirm by \"*\" and wait for the timeout of few seconds.<\/p>","uuid":"700045","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"<p>Wakeup: Ring Key.<\/p> <p>To issue a NIF: 0 plus * (Star Key) in Management Mode<\/p>","manufacturer":{"id":41,"label":"Popp & Co","reference":340,"uuid":"popp","url":""},"category":{"id":23,"label":"Remote Control","category":"RemoteControl","description":"Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc."},"endpoints":[{"id":1328,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":1,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_CONTROLLER"},"generic_class":{"id":7,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SENSOR_NOTIFICATION"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_SENSOR"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":12544,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12557,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"sensor_binary","config":"","label":"Binary Sensor","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3545,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":12545,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12554,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12541,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CENTRAL_SCENE","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3542,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":12556,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12547,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_USER_CODE","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12549,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12546,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":5,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_access","config":"type=ACCESS_CONTROL","label":"Alarm (access)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3543,"options":[]},{"name":"alarm_burglar","config":"type=BURGLAR","label":"Alarm (burglar)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":3544,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":12553,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12548,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12552,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12542,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12551,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_WAKE_UP","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12550,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"0","secure":"1","nonsecure":"0","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12543,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":12555,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"ENCAP","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"Automatic Secure Timeout","description":"After this time a CLOSE is sent to the door lock.
