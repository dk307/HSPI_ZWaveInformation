Similarly to the other WiDom \u201cin wall\u201d devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviours to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.<\/p> <p>Each of its two channels features an integrated consumption measurement device. The Universal Double Switch also boasts the lowest energy consumption on the market.<\/p> <p>At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.<\/p> <p>Thanks to the framework developed by WiDom, the various types of \u201cevents\u201d on the \u201cExternal Switch\u201d can be recognised and associated to actions to be performed on the device, on any associated devices, on all devices on the network. The events that the system recognises are the number of \u201cclicks\u201d or hold on the External Switch.<\/p> <p><br \/>External switch: External button or switch connected to the input I1 or I2<\/p> <p>Events: The actions performed on the external Switch: Clicks or Hold.<\/p> <p>Click: If the external switch is a button (when pressed it autonomously returns to the initial position), a click means pressing and then releasing it. If the external switch is bistable (when pressed it does not return to the initial position), a single click means one single flip of the switch.<\/p> <p>Technical Specifications<\/p> <p>Power Supply:
