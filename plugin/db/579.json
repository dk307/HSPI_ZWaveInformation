The use of socket allows lamps to be safely and \u00a0conveniently replaced. You can On\/Off the light by pressing the button briefly, \u00a0or a long pressing to control the brightness of dimmable lightbulb. This dimmer is a transceiver which is a security enabled device which based on \u00a0Z-Wave Plus technology, and it is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled \u00a0network. Since PAD02 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with \u00a0Secured controller.
