The device can be set up in a Z-Wave network to communicate directly with other end devices such as PIR motion detector, or to report directly to a Z-Wave controller.<\/p> <p>This product supports the S2 security protocol that uses encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security-enabled Z-Wave Plus products. A security-enabled Z-Wave Plus Controller must be used in order to fully utilize the security features of this product.<\/p> <p>This ON\/OFF Plugin module is designed to control the on\/off status of lighting and appliances in the home. Control the connected load by associating it with another end device such as a sensor or switch, or through automations, schedules, and mobile apps by pairing with a compatible Z-Wave controller. Each module is also designed to act as a repeater to re-transmit the Z-Wave signal to ensure that it is received at its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and signal dead spots.<\/p>","protocol_version":"4.061","routing":"1","usage":"<p>Factory Reset (Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable)<\/p> <ol><li>Press the ON\/OFF button 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into exclusion mode<\/li> <li>Within 1 second of step 1, press and hold the button for 5 seconds<\/li> <li>Node ID is deleted.
