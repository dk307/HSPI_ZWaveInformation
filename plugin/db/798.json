This feature is important to have a correct measurement value also for electronic loads like led lamps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br \/>The PSC234ZW has a built-in safety features that will switch-off the output in case of too high temperature or overload.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Additionally the PSC234 has a feature to switch the load on at zero voltage and switch the load off at zero current.
