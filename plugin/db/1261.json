The High-End 10-years smoke detector offers a large test button conveniently accessible even with a broomstick when mounted on the ceiling. The smoke chamber is monitored electronically to avoid any malfunction and wrong alerts. The device will also report its end of life to make sure it is getting replaced on time. Tampering a smoke detector by removing it from the mounting base will issue a wireless alarm command as
