power metering, the module is designed to be installed in, for\u00a0example, lamp outlets and thereby making the connected lamp dimmable through the Z-Wave network.<\/p> <p>The DIMMY module can dim all kind of dimmable light sources from 0 - 250W.<\/p> <p>The built-in power metering can measure the power consumption of the connected load as low as 2W and the\u00a0metering data, both Watt and kWh, are reported to the Z-Wave Controller.<\/p> <p>DIMMY is controlled via Z-Wave commands, for example by Logic Group MATRIX wall switches, and is able to\u00a0send status-reports back to the switches and thereby be a part of a multi-way switching configuration, where\u00a0several switches can control the DIMMY module and the switches receives reports about the actual status of the\u00a0module.<\/p> <p>DIMMY is also working as a repeater in the Z-Wave network and therefore expands the Z-Wave network\u00a0coverage.<\/p> <p>DIMMY is a single channel device, which means that all associations to DIMMY must be made as single channel\u00a0associations.<\/p>","protocol_version":"6.004","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zdi5200","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":80,"label":"Logic
