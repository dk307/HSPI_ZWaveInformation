Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave plus logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer's Z-Wave enabled networks. Remote on\/off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer's Wireless Controller. Each module is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.<\/p> <p>Technical data<\/p> <ul><li>Operating Voltage:240V\/50Hz<\/li> <li>Maximum Load:10Amp Max<\/li> <li>Range:Min 30m line of sight<\/li> <li>Dimensions: 53(D)*67(L)MM<\/li> <li>Net weight: 120g<\/li> <li>Frequency:868.42MHz<\/li> <\/ul>","protocol_version":"4.061","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zw681vde","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"2.001","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":678,"label":"NIE Technology","reference":786,"uuid":"nietech","url":""},"category":{"id":15,"label":"Power Outlet","category":"PowerOutlet","description":"Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there"},"endpoints":[{"id":1783,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":16,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_BINARY"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":17293,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17295,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17299,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_binary","config":"","label":"Switch","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4864,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":17294,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_METER","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"meter_voltage","config":"type=E_V","label":"Electric meter (volts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4859,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_kwh","config":"type=E_KWh","label":"Electric meter (kWh)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4860,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_watts","config":"type=E_W","label":"Electric meter (watts)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4861,"options":[]},{"name":"meter_current","config":"type=E_A","label":"Electric meter (amps)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4862,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":17305,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17302,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17297,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17292,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17296,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM","basic":"0","version":8,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"alarm_power","config":"type=POWER_MANAGEMENT","label":"Alarm (power)","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":4863,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":17301,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17303,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17304,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17306,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17300,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":2,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":17298,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":3,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[],"associations":[{"group_id":1,"label":"Lifeline","max_nodes":1,"controller":"1","description":"","overview":"","id":2492},{"group_id":2,"label":"BASIC SET","max_nodes":5,"controller":"0","description":"","overview":"","id":2493}],"documents":[{"id":2613,"file":"ZW681VDE-A5.pdf","label":"ZW681VDE"},{"id":2614,"file":"ZW681vde.jpg","label":"ZW681VDE"}]}
