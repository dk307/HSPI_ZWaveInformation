The device is delivered as complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series Everlux in color white from RE \/ Duewi. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also\u00a0be configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the dimmer is indicated on a dual color LED for test purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. For dimming the devices apply leading edge phase cutting with a special alignment algorithm for inductive loads. It is therefore possible to dim incandescent lamps, high voltage halogen lights and low voltage halogen lights with traditional transformer. Low voltage halogen lights with switching power supply, LEDs and CFLs must not be attached. The function of the local paddle can be configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control, different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 2 wire system. There is no need for a neutral wire in the wall box.<\/p>","protocol_version":"3.042","routing":"1","usage":"","uuid":"zme05433","version_max":"255.255","version_min":"0.000","wakeup":"","manufacturer":{"id":22,"label":"Z-Wave.Me","reference":277,"uuid":"zwaveme","url":""},"category":{"id":21,"label":"Wall Switch","category":"WallSwitch","description":"Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch"},"endpoints":[{"id":318,"number":0,"label":"Endpoint 0","basic_class":{"id":4,"name":"BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE"},"generic_class":{"id":17,"name":"GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"specific_class":{"id":1,"name":"SPECIFIC_TYPE_POWER_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL"},"commandclass":[{"cmdclass_id":2525,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NO_OPERATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2524,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2528,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL","basic":"1","version":2,"nif":"1","secure":"0","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"switch_dimmer","config":"","label":"Dimmer","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":745,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2529,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2523,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[{"name":"scene_number","config":"","label":"Scene Number","overview":"","deprecated":"0000-00-00","id":744,"options":[]}]},{"cmdclass_id":2534,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2533,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_CONTROLLER_CONF","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2527,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2521,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2526,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_PROTECTION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2522,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2531,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2520,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2530,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_INDICATOR","basic":"0","version":1,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"APP","channels":[]},{"cmdclass_id":2532,"commandclass_name":"COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION","basic":"","version":0,"nif":"1","secure":"","nonsecure":"1","config":"","command_group":"MGMT","channels":[]}]}],"parameters":[{"param_id":1,"label":"LED mode","description":"Set LED indication mode","units":"","overview":"Set LED indication mode","size":1,"bitmask":0,"default":3,"minimum":0,"maximum":3,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2092,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled","id":3024},{"value":1,"label":"Show switch state","id":3027},{"value":2,"label":"Night mode (inverted switch state)","id":3025},{"value":3,"label":"Operated by Indicator Command Class (Default)","id":3026}]},{"param_id":2,"label":"Automatically switch off after","description":"If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time","units":"Sec","overview":"Automatically switch off after: 0 Disabled (Default); 1 \u2014 65535 sec","size":2,"bitmask":0,"default":0,"minimum":0,"maximum":65535,"read_only":"0","write_only":"0","reinclude":0,"limit_options":"0","advanced":0,"confirmation":0,"id":2093,"options":[{"value":0,"label":"Disabled (Default)","id":3028},{"value":1,"label":"Sec","id":3029}]},{"param_id":3,"label":"What to do on RF off command","description":"Defines how to interpret RF Off command.","units":"","overview":"Defines how to interpret RF Off command.
